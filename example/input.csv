 where the ocean meets the land
" The flag we have!! My great grandparents fought for this flag and many of our countrymen died for it. I don't care what people say about this flag it is apart of me and I will fly this flag for the rest of my life and so will my children, it is who I am and forever will be."
 kiwi pride
 choice
 historical allegiance and national identity
" a unique place where we have genuine freedom to choose a path forward that is positive and inclusive. This is a unique opportunity to be brave and creative, and open to change and growth. My father went to war to protectour freedom to choose. I choose to focus more on a positive path ahead than on a past that was not inclusive or fair."
 The new flag should have a white stripe to recognise New Zealand's native name as the land of the long white cloud. Furthermore the colour white represents peace as New Zealand was recently ranked as the fourth safest country in the world according to the 2015 Global Peace Index. Therefore the colour white should be featured in the flag in order to recognise these important aspects of New Zealand's unique identity. Another stripe of traditional icons such as the silver fern should also be incorporated in the flag. This is because the silver fern has come to embody the spirit of New Zealand and is featured in the uniforms of all major New Zealand sports teams as well as in some government institutions. Also the stars of the Southern Cross should be incorporated to highlight New Zealand's location in the South Pacific. Finally a stipe of the colour green should be included in order to reflect New Zealand's clean green image. In addition the colour green symbolises New Zealand's growth as a multi-cultural society in which people from different backgrounds live together in peace and harmony.
 unity
" Being part of the Pacific and having Maori, Scottish and Irish ancestors. I would like to have a flag with a koru to signify growth, the stars of Matariki to signify the Pacific and blue white and red for Great Britain. It may also be good to have an image that represents the mountains and the sea for New Zealand."

 protecting our British heritage and our beautiful environment
" New Zealand is a unique Country, and should have something different, The flag should be a Silver Fern that has 10 sheep on it, one for every letter in ""NEW ZEALAND"" and be a black flag, (All Blacks) with white fern and also white sheep."
 defending our flag
" integrity, respect for the past, equal opportunity for all men and women, a clean green environment, scientific advancement, business innovation, healthy food, winning sports teams, kindness, caring for animals, blue sky, twinkling stars, green grass, sparkling water, curving koru, silver ferns, kiwi ice-cream..."
" A society that provides equal opportunity's and support for all, not just those at the top."
 Taking care of our children and environment and not wasting money on stupid referendums
 the gospel of Jesus Christ on which our nation's values were founded.
 A country that can afford $1m to feed it's kids in school instead of wasting $9m on this 
" I stand for freedom, for democracy and the right to free speech.. I stand for diplomacy and tolerance, which i see as the way forward for the world, combined with education. I stand for equality between genders and races and religions. I stand for the rights of God's humble creatures and the environment. Because we have only been given this world once, and we are the caretakers of it. With privilege comes responsibility. I stand for the forests, and conservation of them. They are our life- breath and our weather moderator. I stand for love and charity. For looking after the frail and the dependent, the very young, and the very old, and the damaged.. That is the measure of a successful and civilised society."
 not wasting millions on new flipen flag!
" justice and equality for all people, forever."

" keeping the current flag. I was taught that if something isn't broken then why fix it? I feel this applies to New Zealand's flag. The current design represents many things to New Zealanders of all generations, especially to those who have fought to protect our country under the current flag. The next generations should be taught about the importance of our history with this flag rather than if you don't like something that is old just change it."

 The right to be engaged in a debate about how we represent ourcountry internationally. Thankyou for this chance. Yes to a mature Independant NZ.
" Leaving the flag exactly how it is and focus more on getting NZ Maori and the elderly back into warm homes instead of them being shunted onto the streets like 2nd rate citizens. NZ is not made of elastic we can't keep stretching to make room for more and more foreigners just because they have money. How are we ok with people sleeping in the streets, we can't turn a blind eye to it forever. One day it might be someone you know in that predicament..."
 The flag as it stands. I swore allegiaI signed the official secrets act under it. These things are NOT transferable and I will recognise no other flag for New Zealand.

 Keeping the New Zealand flag as it is.
 the future
 past heritage both British and Maori and the unique aspects of New Zealand such as the silver fern and designs such as the koru based on our flora
" Christian values, family, equality for all, justice, true democracy whereby govt make decisions based on what majority people want and what will benefit all the peoples of NZ and not just those with money already..."
" A black flag with a white fern. It's iconic and is known world wide. You see more of this flag than the national flag at any sporting event. We've been competing in these colours since forever, and so many of our teams names are based on the fern or the colour black."
" New Zealand/Aotearoa is a new country, both geologically and in terms of recency of human occupation. Socially and culturally we are continuing to develop and grow, unfolding like a fern frond. A koru, in its natural green colour, is therefore perfectly representative of the nation's stage of growth, whereas an unfolded fern, as many favour, might be appropriate once we've become a more understanding, tolerant, compassionate and harmonious society. The Hundertwasser flag provides a beautiful template. Options might include a similar frond, perhaps in a different green, with the vertical black strip removed and the addition of a blue background. His design, fluttering in the breeze, can appear almost alive as it furls and unfurls, as though it were indeed unfolding. A design based on a green koru would be ideal to represent our developing country in terms of its symbolism â which is enhanced by movement, unlike any other nation's flag â simplicity, high-recognition value and uniqueness."
 PROUD TO HAVE OUR N. Z. FLAG RECOGNISED WORLD WIDE OUR FLAG OUR COUNTRY STAND TALL NEW ZEALAND THIS IS OUR TIME IN HISTORY

 I think we shouldn't change our flag. All I care about is my family and kids
 keeping the current flag. A flag is important it is not just a piece of fabric with a picture on it waving in the breeze. Our forefathers fought for our country under this flag. We should be teaching our children about this.
 Continuity with the current flag but adding a reference to pacific heritage
" respecting and remembering our forebears as the foundations of our nation in 2015, as well as showing a bold and assured face to the world."
 a Flag that represents where we have come from - a Maori Symbol and one to represent the British and Irish people who risked all to come to a far off land to start a new life. I want a symbol to represent what we are Great at Sport and inovation in business - a silver fern Something to represent where NZ sits in the Pacific the southern cross or the matariki stars on a blue background to represent the pacific. and a symbol to represent the ruggardardness of the land that has so shaped the people the Tangata.
" NZ is a visually beautiful country. Nz'ers are inventive, punch above their weight in international forums, are a mix of many cultures although have a British heritage, like fairness and help each other. I stand for truth, integrity, justice, peace and family."

 The truth. Because only the truth will solve the very real problems that our country is facing right now. The truth is free and can be delivered tomorrow and your flag change is a $26m waste of time and OUR money
" honest, open NZ with equal opportunities for everyone. I stand for a society that cares. I stand for a nation that is forward thinking."
 $26 million gimmicks
 not wasting money changing something that isn't broken. Shame on NZ.

" Honouring the Treaty of Waitangi, justice and fairness. Strong healthyFamilies are important too."

 keeping the current flag. The Union Jack and Southern Cross do tell our story
" honesty, kindness and empathy"
 This design by Simeon Whyles is a great example of how the Tino Rangatiratanga could be incorporated with the Union Jack. Another option would be to keep the other parts of the Union Jack the original colours and just have the Middle band the red white and black symbol of the Tino Rangatiratanga.
 what those have fort for prior to me being here the flag needs to stay as is don't waste tax payers money
" a flag: without the Union Jack; with the same Southern Cross; traditional Maori colours of red, white "
 fairness
 Spending the money that you are about to waste on something we already have on more important things like poverty education or buying back assets the John key lead government have sold after saying he would not sell any assets. Waste of tax payers money

" keeping the flag the same! But it really doesn't matter what NZ people think does it?, you are just going to do whatever you want. What benefit will spending millions of money on something like this, can you imagine what good you could do with that amount of money???"
 keeping our flag that NZ soldiers have died for. We have just celebrated 100years of Anzac so no need to explain further. I see merit in having a trade flag/ logo of a black kiwi on white. This to be stamped on all NZ made items for local and overseas. Don't change what's not broken. Do not waste money and in the process loose our identity.
 leave NZ flag as it and spend the money on something more productive.
 being nice and kind to others and a New flag for New Zealand

 Keep current flag
" history. Unless New Zealand breaks away from the commonwealth and becomes a Republic then there is no need nor no premise for change. Our current flag represents our country's history. Any new flag would likely represent how we market ourselves or our jargonistic symbols that we use to live up to our firmly embedded stereotypes. We haven't taken that next step as a country to warrant altering our symbol of heritage. If we make that next step, only then we can entertain a change of our flag."

 We belong to the United Kingdom. We are not independent. therefore we should keep our flag as it now stands. If and when we become independent then and only then would I want a change of flag.
 Keeping our present NZ flag - we can't delete our heritage.

Leave the flag as it is - it's beautiful, meaningful and poignant - show some respect for those that have gone before us and for those to come.

" our national flag as a reference library of our cultural story (English). The story is evolving. The flag should reflect shared and joined cultural stories. The imagery of the flag should be added to and joined with cultural partners (Maori), to form a new flag. No part of our story should hidden or removed."
 a collective self and cultural awareness. This reflects who we and how we see ourselves as a nation. The current flag may not be asthetically pleasing but it has represented us as we forged our identity at home and on the world stage. Can we please leave it alone. Our national anthem sucks too but it still brings out the emotions.
 our individuality as a country where we are not confused with Britain and Australia but stand tall as Canada did in deciding on the Maple Leaf flag which is instantly recognisable as CANADA.

When I see our flag and sing our national anthem it brings a sense of pride to know we live in a great country - why oh why do we need to waste so much money on changing what is a great flag?"

" a flag that has NEITHER a solid white NOR a solid black background. Solid white is seen as a flag of surrender, and when at rest, that is what it will look like. A black flag is a symbol of anarchy, not to mention that any white logo (like a silver fern) on a black background will, at a glance, look a lot like the flag of ISIS."
 Not changing the flag Our ancestors fought for and keeping the flag we trust and love and spending tax payers money on better things than this stupid referendum
 freedom
" a bicultural nation located in the Pacific. A land of mountains, forests and grasslands, surrounded by sea. A flag should reflect these aspects in some way, through shapes, designs and colours. Definitely not black or silver-fern."

" culture, sport, bi-cultural heritage, innovation, peace and pride"
" I quite like the Tino Rangatiratanga flag. Whilst many people may find this flag divisive, I feel it reflects New Zealand's heritage and unique cultural background. I think the red, black and white colours are bold and the koru shapes are distinctive. Though I am pakeha, I prefer this flag."
 Leaving the flag alone
" A new flag that represents NZ in a unique way. Different from Aussie etc. NZ is unique, let's be proud of this and reflect it in our national flag. Canada did it -no one confuses them with USA,UK or Aussie, they are unique, so are we. Be a tall poppy and stand out. Proud to be a kiwi."
 the silver fern as its a dominant feature in our culture and our bush.
 Keep the flag the same

" As I possess no artistic and/or design ability, I have attempted to articulate my ideas in written form. However, I would like to preface these by first stating that I am in favour of a flag change but I am anxious about how a new flag could look. What I would like New Zealand's flag to have: 1. Two overriding background colours: - Blue â representing New Zealand's location in the South-west Pacific Ocean - Green â representing New Zealand's predominant landscape 2. A stylised feature in the centre of the flag. Possibly coloured white, but perhaps black, this could be a: - simple MÄori motif - simplified âsilver' fern - simple graphic depiction of the shape of New Zealand - simple graphically depicted kiwi 3. The flag should be seriously simple but nevertheless striking and clearly identifiable around the world as being our flag. Primary school children, moreover, should be able to accurately draw it freehand. Canada's âmaple leaf' is a worthy example where a flag, not dissimilar to our own, was transformed into something very different and simple, and seemingly universally accepted by Canadians and acknowledged around the world within a decade. What I do not want New Zealand's flag to have: 1. The two colours red and black. This is for two reasons: - red and black are the colours of flags for many tyrannous regimes, both historical and contemporary - there is likelihood that the colours red and black could be divisive as they are the colours used by some past and present New Zealand groups which have polarised opinion 2. The âUnion Jack'. This is for two reasons: - we have long ago severed the colonial âapron strings' and our flag needs to be forward focussed indicative of our place as an independent South-west Pacific nation - if Scotland ever votes to be independent of the United Kingdom, the âUnion Jack' as it is at present will be legitimately antiquated 3. Stars as these would both erode the simplicity of the new flag and not provide a complete discontinuity from our present flag, and would also have similarity with much of Australia's flag"

" The Maori people as true Tangata Whenua of this Land, I am sick and tired of NZ Europeans defining the identity of NZ simply from there own moral base.

My taxes are being misappropriated. I work 55-60 hours a week and government officials are spending my hard-earned money, (other people's money), with gay abandon. This is a complete load of tank."

This symbol is so N.Z., it could never be confused for any other, nor that of any other nation than ours."

It includes the three colors of our present flag (red, white and blue), the silver fern to identify with New Zealand, along with the four stars of the Southern Cross to define our place in the world. In addition, and of equal importance, in time of conflict Kyle Lockwood's design as a New Zealand flag would be recognised should half be blown away, be it the top, bottom, or from the left.

" keeping the present flag unchanged. We speak English, are governed by the Westminster parliamentary system, and we owe our legal and judicial system to English law. It is entirely appropriate that this heritage is recognised by the Union Jack on our flag. The suggestion that it is a ""relic of our colonial past"" is immature and indsulting. Leave the flag alone."
" the fact that I come from a great country. I think the union jack is a wonderful symbol but out of date for us although i am still happy for the queen to be our monarch. I have submitted a couple of designs. I don't want to see a logo on our flag but rather a symbol of who we are. There are some fantastic designs. I think I would like people to think we are good people from a good country with a good reputation in the world. I stand for honesty, and empathy for other people, including migrants who can only enrich our country. the majority of our immigrants just want a safe country to bring their children up and get a good job. Just look at America. without immigrants it would not be as strong as it is today"
" respect - for self, others and the environment."
" family, community, respect, culture, pride"
 the current flag under which NZ men and women have died. The NZ armed forces would be laughing stock going to war waving a namby-pamby flag with silver fern or some other native meaningless image. Our tax dollars could be put to far better use. Leave our flag alone!! Immigrant to NZ
" just as Canada is internationally recognised for it's national symbol the maple leaf, New Zealand's silver fern is our national emblem and icon. It is time to ditch the union jack and replace it with a silver fern on a black flag, which has already been our national emblem for over 100 years, since the Invincibles made the silver fern on a black rugby jersey our internationally recognised branding back in 1904. Any new flag design needs to be kept simple and uncluttered - a silver fern on a black flag is exactly that. It is a ""red herring"" to compare this to the ISIS flag - many other countries, despite having little in common, have similar colour flags. Andy Jarden, Wanganui"

" retaining the flag as it is. Under This Flag the citizens of this country built New Zealand, no matter when they arrived here. At the beginning their labours were so extremely difficult and time consuming, progress was slow. What we have now, with the natural assets of open spaces, bush, parks, beautiful beaches, tranquility etc. was created for all of us to enjoy, by Kiwis, under This Flag. Under This Flag, New Zealanders fought in wars for freedom and independence for all. They excelled in sports in different countries, conquered Mt. Everest, distinguished themselves in many fields, such as medicine, music, politics, humanitarianism...the list goes on. Under This Flag, New Zealand developed into a beautiful tranquil country, away from the strife and insecurities of the world. It restored the dignity of people whose arrival here was miraculous-I am one of these people! There will always be people who do not know world flags or where countries are. Retain This Flag- It shows that New Zealanders are capable of reaching for the stars in their lives! Retain This Flag- Spend the money on helping Kiwis still suffering from the earthquake, floods and other disasters. Retain This Flag- but if needed, add the letters ""NZ"" above the lower star. Retain This Flag- it is the symbol of New Zealand."

" a distinctive flag that represents all New Zealanders equally, with the Silver Fern alongside the Southern Cross. I am a supporter of the Commonwealth, however, the Union Jack is losing its relevance to our multi-cultural population. For me, the Silver Fern symbolises New Zealand more than anything else. The Silver Fern is widely used in areas such as government, business and trade, tourism, the armed services, and sport. Furthermore, the Silver Fern represents native New Zealand, it has been stamped on the gravestones of our forefathers who bravely lost their lives at war, it inspired the creation of the Koru, and it is the most recognised symbol of New Zealand globally. In my view, it is also important to retain the Southern Cross on our flag to reflect our location on the planet, to represent the stars that sit above New Zealand equally every night (and indeed the very stars that sat above the canoes and ships of our early settlers), and to maintain a strong link to our current flag. I prefer Kyle Lockwood's original design."

 A renewal of any flag within New Zealand must not result in the impediment of Maori seeking sovereignty rights within this our native country. Using the argument that a new flag is necessary because of this country's cultural landscape is changing and diversity is the 'in word' to support the change is a lie. My Maori view point is this... the New Zealand Crown aka white New Zealand will never give away their colonial fought rights. It is all about religious and political power and Christianity has little accommodation for other religious within parliament. In Maori there are two words: Tauiwi - the stranger within and Manuhiri - a person that has gone through all the cultural initiations and is considered a guest. I suggest these two words should be considered when looking at where Maori are today in our country. It took over 150 years for a Maori flag to be given official cognition by the New Zealand Crown and government of the day so why the change? I am critical of any reference to New Zealander's as being Kiwi for two reasons: The term has been used as a military identification and therefore contentiously associated with the imprisonment of New Zealand pacifist. Kiwi is also a term that Helen Clarke the ex Prime Minister used to divide Maori as being different.
" changing the flag to one that is more relevant and distinct, however, I am extremely disappointed that $26m is being spent on the process. I'm certain that this referendum could have been facilitated at a fraction of the cost if the mandate had have dictated a financially frugal [and appropriate] structure and process, by more effectively leveraging the internet and existing resources/assets, from the outset. That said, I really do hope that this unnecessary extravagance does not distort the path to achieving a truly representative outcome. We will only get one chance."

This has been our history for 100+ years and for a small and young country we need this and we should stand by it as all New Zealander's have done before. It is not a sports icon, it is a nations spirit. All flags throughout the world look alike with their neighbours, however we need to fly ours and be proud: Schools, offices, government buildings, homes, churches, war momorials and national buildings should all fly our flag!!"

We should establish a STATEMENT OF OUR VISION (what we stand for) that is represented by our flag and is acknowledged by those seeking citizenship (""when you join our national family you respect our ideals""). While I acknowledge the high cost of the flag debate, sometimes we need to stop rowing the boat and take the time to agree on the direction we need to go. The demographics of all nations are changing rapidly. We need to speak to our future, increasingly diverse, generations."

 Keeping the flag exactly the same. It's a symbol with meaning that should not be changed. All the money and effort that will be put into this project could be better used for many other things to improve everyone's life in this beautiful country.

 a fresh new design - preferably not silver fern as it looks like a white feather. Koru inspiration would be good. Keep colours red white and blue. Don't care if it has Southern Cross or not. I like Dick Frizzell's designs actually!

A small population of people from a little country with BIG HEARTS, are worldly, who know about and care about everyone else on this planet. The Treaty of Waitangi.

Our forefathers fought under Our current flag for all of these ideals. Let us continue to Stand Together and fight for these ideals. Let us not fall for the 'divide and conquer 'tactics of the enemy. God Defend New Zealand. Arohanui to All."

" efficient use of government resources to support the infrastructure in New Zealand. As a provider and user of health care and as an educator and user of the educational system, there are obvious compromises in both fundamental aspects of infrastructure due to fiscal restrictions. Therefore, despite consideration or change of the New Zealand flag being on the bucket list of tasks to achieve before John Key does not get re-elected (and lets face it he can not be PM forever regardless of your support), it is irresponsible to allocate public funds to this issue when there are children and patients suffering from fiscal limitation in the education and health care system. Secondly, I agree with those that empathise with the RSA approach that brave and courageous New Zealanders battled, died, suffered and some still remember, carrying that flag with pride on their uniform throughout global conflicts of their lives. Dis-assembling the flag is disrespectful to them, their memory, their families and New Zealand of their suffering. Finally, having lived in UK, Australia and New Zealand, I couldn't care whether globally Americans think our Flag is Australian, the lack of intelligence to recognise the difference does not constitute an emergency on our part to change our flag so that some dim-wit can spot a difference."
 Peace
 keeping our flag as it is. It IS unique and has a nod to our past heritage whilst showcasing our Southern Hemisphere location. Men and women have fought under its banner and I do not believe that changing it shows respect to our history. It is a flag to remain proud of and we deserve to celebrate all the achievements our small nation has accomplished under its banner.
 I am proud of my British heritage and want the flag to demonstrate this. I would like to see the union jack maintained. New Zealand has been built on British principles and hard work. This history must be symbolised by the new flag. Malcolm Butler

 Social Justice
" I stand for a blue background - the blue of our big sky with clean air, the surrounding oceans - these are central to our national psyche and well-being. I stand for including the Southern Cross as before, because it is also central to our being and national identity. I stand for acknowledgement of our bicultural identity in the flag. I really like the image representing Tinorangatiratanga, incorporating the flag (Union Jack) with a very well-recognised symbol. This is a truly bicultural symbol, and will also represent our national identity."

When I look at our flag, I think of our Fathers, Grandfathers, Uncles and Great Uncles, who fought, and lost their lives in World War 1 and 2, under our present flag. It also reminds me of our many great olympians. It would be a great shame to change it."

" To tick all boxes I think Michael McDonald's Flag design of half our existing flag with the Southern Cross moved under the Union Jack to accommodate the Silver Fern with black to the right of it would be closest to achieving that - It would hopefully satisfy those who wish to retain our existing Flag as it still looks and feels very much like it, but will also cater to those who want a change with our already internationally recognised and unifying Silver Fern, instantly distinguished from the Australian Flag but still retaining our closeANZAC relationship and place in the world. BUT I think if we do change to this design we need to incorporate the Tino Rangatiratanga or similar without making it too busy, perhaps across the Middle band of the Union Jack or across the bottom of the Flag. We need to acknowledge both our (main) heritages not just one."

" Respect for the people, flora, fauna and the land and a country everyone can decently live in.

For the parent who will work 2x jobs to ensure that their child attends a good school to get a good education in the hope that one day their child and grandchildren will own their own home. For the average NZer who will sit in the blazing sun or freezing cold to catch a fish to feed their family because they can not afford to buy any meat. For the average Kiwi who will grow their own vege garden to ensure their is always something to put on the table to eat and cut down the odd tree for firewood to ensure they can stay warm in the winter because they can't afford to use too much power. For the normal NZer who wants more and great things for our children. For NZ to be the caring and nuturing country that we are known for. To ensure that NZer's and tangata whenua are looked after and provided for so that in return we have a caring, nuturing, supportive, safe and prosperious country for all.

 kiwi freedom and peace
 our unique kiwi culture. For pride in our beautiful country. I love the blues of our waters and the greens of our land. I love the silver fern symbol of NZ and I believe we are ready for a new flag that reflects who we are as New Zealanders. I would like to see a simple flag that is instanly recongisable and not similar to what other countries already have.
" I stand for equality where everyone has equitable opportunities. A shared responsibility- to respect and show our history; how we have developed and become who we are. To hold a shared understanding of the future and how we as a nation move forward. To remember and honour those who fought for today's freedom. To stand for all, to stand as one. We are all New Zealanders and proud."
 our country's English heritage
" a flag that conveys something all New Zealanders can relate to and be proud that characterises our nation by speaking of our landscape (maybe mountains, rivers, three islands), or fauna (maybe kiwi, tuatara), or flora(maybe silver fern or kauri tree etc) or unity of people. This needs to be simply depicted by colour (maybe blue of the sea around our coast, green of our land), style and shape. Black should be used very sparingly."
" equality and fairness, no pandering to any one sector or ethnicity"
" wisdom, providence and transparency. In changing the flag we will lose a visual reminder of the ANZAC bond, currently manifested in the similarity of the New Zealand and Australian flags. This would be ironic in a year when we are commemorating WWI and Gallipoli. A flag change is not a priority at this time and the much-needed funds being spent on the referenda could have been put to more-deserving uses."
" Keeping our flag the same! Don't waste money on something that is nowhere near as important as our children's health, the health of each family unit, and of our communities."
 Not having a backwards referendum. Why are we are wasting money on promoting a different design when we have yet to establish if we actually want to change our flag?

" Keeping it real, keeping it simple and reminding each and everyone one of us who calls themselves a Kiwi just how lucky we are to have the freedom to make choices. Our flag isnt who we are, we already know who we are, we're Kiwis!"

" A country that accepts difference and diversity. A country that is inclusive of all people, that celebrates and values each person for what they have to offer, including our disabled (intellectual and physical). I stand for one New Zealand people where all ethnicities, cultures and religions are respected as equal and where women achieve true equality with men. I believe our flag should honour our heritage but differentiate us from others. It should include a symbol of our uniqueness - New Zealand was a land of unique birds prior to the settlement of humans, the inclusion of a kiwi or feather design would seem appropriate."

" I want a new flag that represents all of the things that make New Zealand's history of multi-cultural ism so special, a simple design (3 or 4 colours) with a reference to Maori like a fern frond or koru (maybe a bunting like the old air mail envelopes?) With the southern cross as a reference to our southern latitude. I think our flag needs to be significantly different from our Australian mates "

" heritage being the English/European origins for many of the people and the Pacific origins for many more. Black is not acceptable as I have been at major events in stadiums and it would be lost in the background clouds and dark sky. Blue conveys our sea surroundings green our land, red our sunshine.

" our past being our Nation today becoming tomorrow which, as New Zealanders, includes our first flag through to our current and future flag of tomorrow. Our current flag is of us and we of it - it stands for us as New Zealanders. Its colours red, white and blue are a continuity of a unity of ingredients from our first flag's conception to the present into the future. My ancestry, my country, my land, my home, my future, the Nation's struggles and jubilations from its inception to the present day are represented in the statement of our current flag and its colours. My preference is for our flag to remain as it is - it's the flag all New Zealand forefathers fought Wars to keep in tact as a symbol of who we are as New Zealanders and our country of freedom, justice and democracy. Our current flag is the sole statement of our country. We have taken possession of our flag in that it is our flag - New Zealand's flag. Our National Anthem salutes our flag - it is imbedded in our New Zealand psyche. If a change has to be made, then of the designs presented to choose from the one below is my choice:"
 national flare and pride in NZ
" freedom of expression, freedom of religious belief or none, respect for all, taking reponsibility"
" my country welcoming all people, for family, for our identity being instantly recognisable, for the flora and fauna being acknowledged as a large part of who we are."
" respect, tradition and history, excellent education for all, innovation and retaining our beautiful environment"
 Keeping our flag
" the shelter and protection that the origins of the current flag gave to those who asked for it. Once the Musket Wars had seen their victories and gains came to stagnate, history records that the descendants of the first migrants wanted, Law and Order. Many of those descendants of the first migrants had observed overseas the benefits of the shelter and protection of being under the Flag. Many more have since given their own life's to allow us to still benefit from the shelter and protection that being under the Flag current gives."
 Freedom and acceptance. Not spending a stupid amount of money on a flag.
 Not spending millions on making a new flag!
 Future opportunities and not discriminations of the past.
 equity
" Any flag we choose must reflect our uniqueness and make it easy for the people of NZ to recognise their flag and for NZers and non- NZers to recognise our flag from afar. Focus on the Sthn Cross, the Silver Fern and strong colours for the whole world to identify us and to ensure that we are not similar to any other flag.I would also like to ensure that our design is recognisable when there is no wind. The Silver Fern on the outer edge??"

 NOT CHANGING THE FLAG!!!
 Opportunity for me and my family
 the same
" the current flag, why change something that is not broken?"
" a flag that is uniquely New Zealand and contains essential symbols, without trying to crowd the flag with stars, kiwis, Maori designs and so on. Simplicity is necessary. One symbol that brings together Maori and European people, as well as the land is the NZ coat of arms, which shows well in a few of the designs presented. And a simple silver fern rising from left to right (suggestion of forging ahead) on a blue background would convey a simple, recognisable NEW ZEALAND."

" kiwi heritage,environment protection, fairness and justice for all in the flag I would like to see the southern cross, a silver fern real like a small ensign"

" Spending the money on something worthwhile like the Starship Hospital plane instead of something we don't need....like a new flag.Wake up NZ! We DON'T need this! The money could be so much better spent on education, hospitals etc!!!!!!!!!"
 equality for indigenous people
 A new flag because our current one is often taken for the Australian flag. As a retired Travel Agent and European Tour Leader for many years. I am sure we need our own Flag and our own identity for Tourism plus our teams competing abroad. My Adobe design would not upload so I will E mail it.
 our past and our future
 a flag which is identifiable as representing New Zealand and casts aside old connections to England (as Canada did when they changed their flag in approx 1968)
 not distracting the people of NZ from serious issues by waving a flag change debate around as if it was a matter of vital importance
 partnership
" Keeping the current flag and saving the country money to go to more important issues, like health, crime and education."
" the past, present and future which includes our flag colours - Red, White and Blue. Without the past acknowledged and learning from moments of our highs and lows, which have in turn shaped our nation and we its people, we cannot have a present or future. Intrinsic to this journey and communicated to the world has been the New Zealand flags of red, white and blue. From 1830 our very first flag sought to ensure our ongoing economic, social and cultural success and our identity â successive flags continue to hallmark our contribution and our uniqueness as âKiwisâ to the world. We cannot have a future without the incorporation of red, white and blue on the flag â to do so insults past generations and the present generations who acknowledge the efforts and contributions made by all New Zealanders to date. Without red, white and blue we are disconnected to the future. I stand for a flag that symbolises New Zealand's past, present and future â red, white and blue â that is, retain our existing flag or change to the following proposed flag of red, white and blue:"

 I vote for not changing the flag and wasting our tax payers money.
 A nation which is firmly grounded in this country and within the south Pacific region.One which reflects our union of the indigenous people (tangata whenua) and the Crown (our government) which represents those who have come to this country (tauiwi) in past 200-300 years.
 A FLAG WHICH OVERSEAS CITIZENS WILL EASILY IDENTIFY
 A progressive multicultural country that values Maori and their special place in it.
 Looking after the interests of Maori and other people in NZ the current flag does this for me
 Independence in the Pacific
" I think the public should have had the opportunity first to decide if they wanted a new flag. Replying by post or online as we have been asked to do to state what we stand for. This would have saved a lot of money that has been spent on the road show, salaries, air travel, accomodation,time etc.The result of the referendum maybe the current flag and the money spent wasted. What is our identity, Maori and English heritage with a mix of others particularly Pasifika. -our strength. Our foundation Christian values, family, social justice Freedom and sacrifice NZers have fought and been peace keepers"
" our bicultural heritage, our position in the Southern Hemisphere, (the Southern Cross), our youth as a nation, and how we are developing our own identity."
 keeping the nz flag the way it has been for years its a original flag has been for years as a Maori citizien we citizens of new zeland should fight for our right and keeping the new zealand flag as is
" UNITY. I think it is a commplete waste of money to change the flag. However, if it is deemed essential we could honour the original 1834 trading flag of New Zealand, chosen by 25 chiefs and their followers and named the Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand. It is distinctive and appealing."

We need to acknowledge our ancestors and history, embrace our present and be excited by our future. We are unique in our lifestyle and values because of where we live...this Uniqueness should be reflected anywhere in the world when our flag is on display"
" Jesus.Truth, honesty, justice, fairness, kindness, reliability, forgiveness, honour and equality. I like our flag being similar to Australia's, since we are both ""Down Under"" and ""neighbours"". But if we do have anew one, may it be a flag of meaning and BEAUTY and if the Silver fern is incorporated into it, then please may it be silver and not white! So that it will glisten in the sunlight."
 a new flag that clearly represents New Zealand and ALL its' people without bias or confusion.
 If anything the addition of perhaps a Kiwi or Fern to the existing Flag only
" New Zealand and all that New Zealand believes in. We are a multi-cultural race of people who have gone out and populated this world under the same flag that everyone recognises as new Zealand's. Who would know which country we are if we change what we have. Who cares if it's close to some other countries flags. The reason for this is because we are part of the commonwealth and so we have COMMON flags to identify this. We are one nation that stand together for the right of ALL New Zealanders and we always will no matter what the flag looks like. Changing the New Zealand flag is like saying we will become part of Australia forever not be our own entity. We are one and so should stand under all our flags, Maori, New Zealand, and sports flags with the pride that we are so renown to have"
" respecting the sacrifice of our young men and women who fought for our freedom under the exsisting nz flag,it should not be changed for poilitical expediency"
" Commonwealth , heritage...history. Let the fern stay representing the sports teams. This identity is already in place. The current flag image brings added depth to our history alongside our already existing prominent maori cultural identity. The issue really is an aesthetic one. The current flag is actually a good design. If it ain't broke don't try and fix it..maybe strengthen the colour blue up if you want to make it look new. There is a risk of over intellectualising."
 the existing flag as did my parents and grandparents and not for politicians wasting taxpayers money
 Peace and justice. For all to express what they believe in and not force 1 opinion above another.

" I stand for a flag that retains the Red,White and Blue which are associated with Freedom. If sports people want a sports flag then one could be designed just for sports such as a black panel showing a fern. where the red would be on a National flag. In this respect the military will alter a chosen design to suit their traditions such as the navy and their white ensign. But for a national flag it should remain Red, White and Blue."
 friendliness
" a flag that represents the symbols that New Zealanders have ""organically"" used to represent themselves in relation to how they see those flags represent them to the world. For me those are the national Maori flag, the silver fern on a black background and the United Tribes of New Zealand flag (1835). What I do not want is a flag that reminds me of a corporate, that is the ""Sanitarium-style"" flag that John Key seemingly endorsed when it was suggested that the silver fern flag could be confused for the ISIS/ISIL flag. Although it could be argued that the silver fern/black background may remind some of sports-based corporates it has been taken up by many New Zealanders as a symbol that they (and I) believe represents what New Zealand stands for. Changing the background colours to blue/ white and red would create a symbol where rather than first hearing the NZ anthem in my head, I hear the dirge ""Kiwi kids are Weet-bix kids..."". While I was a weet-bix kid, I don't want a flag that may be perceived as standing for what we eat at breakfast and a religious denomination. So please keep modifications/ combinations to either the silver fern/black background, the national Maori flag and the ""United Tribes"" flag at a minor level, and also give NZers the opportunity to accept or reject the silver fern/blackbackground flag. ISIS is temporary, New Zealanders' identification with the silver fern and the colour black is permanent. Finally when you do choose upon the design please do the Sanitarium litmus test. I don't want to have to run a ""A flag for NZ not Sanitarium"" campaign. Thanks for your patience and understanding. Jonathon Spring"
" equality, justice, fair representation of Maori and Pakeha, cooperation, prosperity"

 freedom of speech and freedom of access to information.
 no change to the flag at this time. It may be appropriate if we become an independent country some time in the future. The english Queen remains our Queen and our present flag should remain. The Prime Minister does not bide by referendums and I don't believe he will change this time.

Why are so many people living in poverty or just getting by in NZ? Why not encourage those on benefits who are able to work or educate themselves. Why are we wasting millions on a new flag that nobody wants? Its a disgrace, the flag is part of our history!! There are much more important things that we could be spending our money, time and effort on!! So disappointed in our government right now"
 a great Aotearoa/New Zealand for all who live and visit here
" accountability, doing the right thing, not wasting money"
" Initially I thought yes we need a new flag. Ours is too similar to Australia and needs to me more like Canada's, everyone knows what country the red maple leaf flag is from right? Then a few of my friends reminded me that our grandfathers fought for that flag and it made me think some more. Then I saw an news item, our flag was in Times Square NYC and a reporter was asking people what country it was from, 99% said Australia. So I think we need a new flag with some black in it and a silver fern, thank you."
 The Flag of New Zealand staying the same. Do not CHANGE. Josie hendry

 being proud to be a New Zealander
 making sure that everyone in New Zealand are able to provide for their children and that support is available to support families who need it. Millions of dollars spent on a flag when programmes in the community are being cut is something that I believe that New Zealand does not stand for.

What that piece of material stands for does not change, even if the flag does.

 The flag consideration panel having to read the comments on this website and take them seriously. Have the courage to leave the flag alone as we are asking you to do. Don't be yes men or women just because the government is paying you. I don't know why John Key is ignoring the majority of NZealanders but don't be like him. That's our tax money you are spending.

We already have alternate flags such as the silver fern or kiwi that appears at sports events etc - that's fine.

 New Zealand. We have an identity that is recognized worldwide. The current flag is a symbol of many things that make up our nation.

" keeping our Nations flag as it is. I am a 34 year old Kiwi male and proud of it!! I think changing our flag will have more consequences than people understand, such as our ties to the Commonwealth. I still think that having the ""Silver furn"" flag for our sports teams is great (but not as our national flag) because it's easily related to New Zealand for some people/foreigners. Some of the people that have this choice to possibly change our countries flag, I don't think are old enough to understand the changes to our country this will make let alone the COMPLETE WASTE of MONEY, Time and resources it has turned into!! To be honest I could go on ALL day for reasons why we shouldn't change our flag but the main one is really the waste of money it is on something that's ""not broken"", So why fix it!! Especially when we have to watch all these shocking headlines in ""Our countries"" news about how many starving children and struggling young families we have in ""our own backyard"" and how hard it is for the average Kiwi to own their own home!! Its very disheartening how the person who came up with this idea has soo much Power in their voice with the ability to make such changes that will affect ""every New Zealander"" individually, yet is about to do something that wont change anything for the 'good' of New Zealand as a whole!! I know I am only one person with one voice but I know for sure, if my voice or thoughts were as powerful as that persons, I would definitely be using it for the good of ""our"" country and not just to make waves in an already unsettled pond and use all these chances to add more hope, choice and ability to the people of our beautiful country, New Zealand!! Thank you for the chance to have my say, I also hope that I'm not the only person with these thoughts. Here's to a beautiful future. Bryan."

" recognising that NZ does have a unique identity in the world and that a new flag would further identify this, but not at the expense of being distracted from issues which should be addressed first. These issues include: Climate change; housing(lack of, outrageously beyond reach of ordinary people in Auckland); poor education achievements of some groups of society; lack of employment; the lack of debate of the governments intention to sign trade agreements (TPPA in particular).

" being proud of my country, and the images that represent it. We need a flag that is distinctively New Zealand, identifiable around the world. Black remains our internationally-known national color, and must be a part (though not all) of any new flag if it is to be truly recognizable as being of New Zealand."

 Spending 26 million on creating industry and helping families in need. Not wasting money on a flag

 it's a stupid idea and waste of money spend it on other important things like children and housing!!

 leave the current flag alone. A gross waste of taxpayers money that should be going towards paying off the countries debts.

" Leave the current flag alone I have family who have fought and died to protect it and what it stands for, by attempting to change it you are disrespecting them and what they have done for you , giving you the free country that we have today. so stop waisting tax money on such rubbish and spend it on something more productive for the good of the country."

" A flag that represents NZ, - not the Commonwealth, or is confused with the Aussie flag. A flag that all Kiwis from all ethnic backgrounds, would be proud to wear and represent. We may understand now why we have a Union Jack on our flag, but in 50years, no one will know why, as we drift further from British ties. Change it now with something simple, that the world will know what it represents."
" freedom, equality, fairness, tolerance, nature"
 Keeping the existing flag and stop wasting any more of our money which could be better used for the benefit of a myriad of other causes for instance prostate cancer screening.

 not wasting any more money on this nonsense!
" a flag that represents our past, our present,our future. The Union Jack is where we came from; the blue is the Pacific Ocean where we are; the stars are where we are going."
 Integrity
 Democracy. this government is trying to pull the wool over our eyes with this distraction. First of all we need to find out if the population actually wants to change the flag and if the answer is yes then only then do we start with the options.
 I fully believe that the union jack has to stay as it was there for the founding of our nation. In place of the stars either the silver fern or a stylised Koru. The fact that some of the people that may be making comment don't have the same vested interest in New Zealand is also a concern
 Respecting Maori and Pakeha contributions to New Zealand. The current flag only does one of these jobs and therefore it is time to bid it goodbye.
 No need to change this great flag this countrie has grown and is known for these coloures
 How about we leave the flag alone and have a referendum on the TPPA. Stop trying to throw distractions to the NZ public.
 Keeping the current flag and spending the money in education instead
 Keeping it OG
" the things that make us Kiwis. Honesty, Humour,sense of fair play, not afraid to try. The current flag doesn't show that, it shows Colonial heritage. Lets have a new design, Silver fern and black background - instant Kiwi!"
" MÃ¤ori, WhÃ¤nau, Respect, Integrity"
 A nation that has existed since 1840 with a British and Maori heritage. This should be reflected in our flag. At the present time the British heritage is reflected more strongly than the Maori heritage.

 John Key Getting Fired If This Goes Ahead. Leave The Flag Alone!
" I understand the idea of re-branding.. but I really think that this flag stuff is a distraction. There are more important things to focus on. In NZ the gap between haves and have not's is widening and we are doing very poorly in areas such as environment, health disparities, recognizing tangata whenua. I wish we were having a public forum about issues like the TPPA and the dumbing down of our media. Our current flag does tell a story. Remember that spark was telecom... but it feels different "
 Changing the Flag

I like Frank Martinoff's NZ 1 Tribal Kiwi Version 4. It is fierce and proud. It would fly distinctively in international company, hang quietly in courtrooms and embassies. It would look festive over sports stadiums, solemn on the coffin at state funerals, superb at the top of the Waitangi mast. And it could NEVER be mistaken for the Aussie flag."

 Leave it alone
 Leaving the flag alone. The country cannot afford to change it. We want our tax funds to go to helping making our country better. People are dying because they can't get decent treatment in hospitals and you want to waste money on this this ego boosting frivolous thing. They vast majority of the world doesn't even no we exist and changing our flag won't change that. Our flag is great leave it alone!
 Acknowledging the past and the present of our country. Therefor my suggestion is to keep our flag but add a silver fern down the side of it. That way we are still acknowledging the people that fought for our country and the silver fern which is assocaited with New Zealand these days.
" a country that has Polynesian and British heritage, and is a proud and successful sporting nation. The present flag shows the Polynesian (Southern Cross and blue ocean) and British (union flag and blue ocean) heritage. It needs only the bottom left-hand blue square (below the union flag) to become a black square with a silver fern to add our sport."
" social justice! How can anyone endorse the use of over twenty six million dollars on a new flag when children are hungry, houses are cold, people die on hospital waiting lists and people working full time can't earn enough to support their families properly. I do not want my tax spent on a new flag. It is a flagrant misuse of public money."
 a free independent country and a flag that does not have another nation's flag on it.
 keeping our current flag
 We are a sophisticated Mature Independent Sovereign country and we deserve a unique flag of our very own just like the vast majority of the rest of the world (except Australia!) We are so switched on that we can choose our very own design and not have to wave a flag of someone else's choosing We deserve a new flag that does not remind us of our colonial past. Our present flag is after all only a 'Spoilt Ensign' foisted on us their lordships in 'The Admiralty' - We deserve Better!
" Being green, clean, unity and integrity, unique and staunch"

" New Zealanders come first in jobs, land and housing. Stop the corporate greed and give kiwis wages that they can actually live on."

 Pride in our country where out flag will stand alone ane not be confused with another country's flag.
 keeping the current flag and not wasting our money on this whole research/referendum project. I think there are better ways to spend our money and if there is to be a referendum it should be for something worth our time.

" A united,undivided,democratic New Zealand"
 a multi-cultured non-secular independent country which does not involve itself in foreign wars as proxy for larger countries. New Zealand should cast off the obsolete trappings of colonial rule and become a truly independent and free state.
 commonwealth freedom history british
" A connection with New Zealand's Commonwealth and British history, recognition of New Zealand's uniqueness (its location on the planet and its culture) and acknowledgement of its diversity of ethnicity. I treasure this country's official status of opposition to racial and religious prejudice. I am proud of its ""firsts"", such as being the first nation to give women the vote. I really like Denise Fung's flag - which includes the Southern Cross, the traditional Commonwealth colours, and the Maori/New Zealand emblem of the koru, which appears on so much Maori art, representing new life, strength, and peace - thus depicting what I am proud of in this beloved land: a nation where people can start a new life (we are all immigrants, even our Indigenous people); a nation that , hopefully, will continue to strive for peace; a nation that, although tiny, is not afraid to stand up for what it believes in. I have copied Denise Fung's flag below. I also like that it has impact, as opposed to Hundertwasser's suggestion for a new flag, and other proposals, many of which, to me, seem to favour some aspects of our culture over others, thus excluding elements of our nation and its inhabitants rather than being inclusive so that everyone in our country can relate to, and be proud of, our flag."

 a flag that is easy to draw. Think of primary school children around the world!
" freedom, equality, justice, peace, caring for our environment, independence from the UK, not being confused with Australia. I would like to see a new flag, but I don't want any black on it. I would like to see green for our bush, blue for our waters, and white for peace. I like the idea of a kiwi, as it symbolises our uniqueness, our small size, but plucky character."
" I can't draw my flag idea, but I would like to see the Tino Rangatiratanga design as the basis. But with the top half blue for our skies, the thin white line in the centre representing our mountain tops and the lower half green for our paddocks."
" Equality, fairness,integrity,strong family bonds,good education, peace, enviorment."
 A GREENER FUTURE
 A distinctive well recognised flag indicitive of our brave country. Why are we changing our already high profile flag to start all over again? We are but a tiny dot on the international radar so why make it harder with a difficult rebranding which will likely take many years to achieve the level of recognition that we have worked so hard for. Try some overt and frequent reinforcement of our often hidden National pride first!
 Respecting 
 The tradition that underlies our flag as it is now and the flag that has flown through wars and many sporting events. I cannot believe we are spending so much on this referendum. We have had many other referenda which Governments have simply ignored
 equality
 being a proud 'kiwi' therefore we need a flag with a kiwi on it and nothing that is like Australia's flag. Then everyone in the world would recognise our flag immediately and not think it is the Australian flag. We were in Australia recently at a international car rally with one New Zealander in it and everyone thought they were Australians by the flag. Not good.
 loyalty and trust
 not spending tax payers money on something that is unnecessary and frivolous. #listentoNZ.
" saving money and using wisely, not wasting it on a stupid campaign!"

" tradition, our heritage, freedom and all that our country has achieved. A lot of our forefathers have paid the ultimate price in the name of New Zealand. I think our flag should be easily recognised and not one that at a glance people think is ""Australia"". The silver fern or kiwi should be included somewhere on the flag together with our 4-stars."
" a New Zealand based on: equality and freedom, one vote each, all equal before the law; on ""clean and green"" and concern for the environment; and on bi- and multi-culturalism...and I think all these values are captured by the silver fern which is already our most universal symbol."
" a unique New Zealand with no shared borders, able to be true to itself."
" our British and Maori heritage, democracy, family, our freedom, and justice."
" an independent nation which is based on the principles of fairness, decency and inclusiveness of all of its citizens who share those values."
" I think this campaign has been a waste of money. NZ has more urgent priorities than changing the flag. I have no objection to the existing one, which reflects the British heritage of NZ as a first world nation state. So leave it as is... If a change is to be made, I woud support the c. 1835 flag of the United Tribes of Aotearoa."

" CHANGE, New "
" a flag which is immediately identifiable as New Zealand's. Having sailed around the world there were areas, such as the Red Sea, where we did not want to be confused with Britain, as our foreign policy was contra to theirs and that of Australia. It could have meant the difference between life and death. The flag must be recognizable at rest as well as when flying. I have seen some designs which incorporate the silver fern, southern cross and traditional colours which would do the job."
 New Zealand sign language
" opportunities,dignity,compassion, community, inspiring leadership, gratitude, integrity, authenticity, humility, resourcefulness, creativity, entrepreneurship, justice and mercy, responsible guardianship of our natural resources."
" a new flag that represents a New Zealand that stands on it's own and is proud of being a unique country with uniquely beautiful landscape, people ,and indigenous culture. I think we should use a symbol on it that is a NZ symbol (like Hundertwasser's koru flag), so the flag can't be confused with any other country's flag."

Reminds us to look up / look up for strength / inspiration / in gratitude for where we are in life/ guides others to our shores etc. Please keep us all in your minds and hearts as you travel this Flag Debate journey xxxx"
" an inclusive design of NZ ers. I think the flag should show an independent country by ditching the Union Jack. WW1 soldiers fought for King and Empire and it and does not represent us. I would like to see the Kiwi on it as we like to call ourselves Kiwis. I 'surprisingly' like some of the Maori designs too but not the Te Rangitira flag. (some of the green/white/blue). I think the Silver fern should stay for athletes, although there are some designs which include it and they look okay."
" I stand for respecting Historical decisions, Moari, Self-determination, equality, Justice, plurinationality, multi-cultural, collegiality, honouring our dead (eg ANZAC and service personnel), manawhenua"

" changing our flag to represent what is special and unique about NZ. To all the people talking about the heritage of the current flag, explain to the Maori what part of the flag speaks to their heritage - the original people of this land. To all the people talking about how the current flag represents them fine, tell me what you wear or wave when you support any NZ sporting endeavour. Red, white "

" Spending26 million on improving health care and helping children living in poverty, not changing our flag"
 Tradition
" not changing the flag and looking at more important issues in NZ, and utilising that money for the more important thing! I cant see why the Government cant see this!! I voted for JK, and still stand by that, but NOT on this issue, it needs to stop and the government need to start listening to the people that pay their salaries! Please, STOP this!"
 A unified nation that remembers the past and use it to build a better future. If the flag changes then keep the southern cross as it represents our part of the world.
" Respect, Live, Equality and Fairness"
 spending money where it is needed. a new flag is a luxury not a necessity.
 Change. But not of the flag.. I rather spend this money to create more jobs and feed the hungry...
 Keeping our flag the same!

" freedom, equality pride and I think the flag should remain unchanged. Spend the money on something the whole country would benefit on."
 All the new Zealand troops past an present serving under our current flag. And respect. Keep our flag.
 Keeping the flag as it is. 26million could be used to house the hundreds of homeless or feed children. I stand for real priorities.
 equality - not just in law
" a confident, independent Pacific nation"
" Fresh air, land, whakapapa and whanau"
" Keep the existing flag. Don't waste money to change it. I am proud to wear our current flag on my uniform. It represents so much to so many people, past and present. Spend the money helping people who really need it."
 A recognised identity throughout the world for New Zealanders that reflects our heritage and uniqueness.
 a strong NZ with meaningful links to our past. Our present flag is one of those link. We abandon it at our peril.
 Keeping the current flag. Our tipuna fought for our country under that particular flag...what are we telling them about the sacrifice they made in changing it? That they fought for nothing!
" Keep the flag as it is don't waste any more money, there are homeless and needy people who need that help."
 equality and freedom
" The silver fern. I feel that the new flag should simply be the silver fern (a well known kiwi icon, almost a second flag already). It could be a silver fern with a Union Jack in the corner. There suits everyone."
 Keep our flag and spend the money on education or health!
 British heritage n the Monarchy
 New Zealand and keeping the existing flag that is recognised worldwide. The referendum money could be spent on more important social issues.
 heritage we are a Pacific nation and two people signed the Treaty. We are also a migrant nation but we are here in the Pacific. We are more than just a rugby nation so a black and white flag with the silver fern on it is very sports orientated especially rugby. We are more than that.
" The land, the sea, the sky, the freedom of speech, the quality of life - and what might best represent this? The Silver Fern and the Southern Cross"

 Family
" being a NZ resident, who likes the flag to be specific for NZ"
 The old flag
 being a NZ resident
 Pride 
 Honesty and integrity New Zealand is now a multi national country. We need to remember our heritage. If people from other countries don't know our flag it doesn't matter as long as we know our flag. It won't make a difference who we are by changing the flag. I am a New Zealand and I am proud of what I stand for and my country. Don't change the flag
 NZ being a place where our Christian foundations of 'the good news of great joy for all people' has defined who we are 
 New Zealand!! Lots has been done over the years beneath the current flag. It is well respected and recognised so should remain the same.
 Not changing our flag. I am proud of our NZ flag and see no reason to change it. What a complete waste of time and money this whole exercise has been. Disgraceful! Why not have a referendum on what NZ'RS want to spend 26 million on...
 Democracy and for all to be equal.
" freedom of thought, equality, peace, safety and opportunity. Reflect our iconic Silver Fern, Southern Cross and Kiwi."
 Spending the country's money wisely and not wasting twenty six million on something that doesn't need fixing when we could fix so much more with that money elsewhere such as education and stopping poverty.
 the current flag of New Zealand
 Cherishing our history and keeping our current flag.
" ""God of Nations at thy feet in the bonds of love we meet.... God defend New Zealand "" against the PC brigade, and politicians with a vested interest in selling this country to the big corporates...."
" a small part of the Milky Way Galaxy, the Southern Cross (stars) or nearest out-of- solar system neighbors. We have mixed races living here, predominately Maori and European but we are all Kiwis. We have the sea and forests that are part of our shared souls. The flag should show stars (5 in a cross), sea (blue styalised wave- koru shape)and silver fern(as per the All Blacks etc). Our colours should remain historical-red, white and blue and some new ones."
 changes and improvements in NZ that will improve living in our country
" Spending the 26 million to feed the hungry kiwi children,I stand for matariki day to be national holiday, I stand for non egomaniac politicians who stop wasting our hard earned money"
 The majority of NZers want the flag left as it is. Less than 20% are trying to force a change. What a total waste of money that could be better spent elsewhere. My stand is leave the flag as it is.
" Integrity, hard work, ingenuity, beautiful beaches and mountains, welcoming"
 Keeping the flag our grandparents died protecting. It is our identity. It should NOT be changed.
" Keeping our flag the way it is leave it we don't want a change you John key you are the only one who wants a new flag! Keep our flag 25mil spend it on the kids the homeless and people who struggle with life , having you on power makes me ashamed of being a kiwi!!!"
 Making the point that changing the flag should not be a budget priority. I am happy with the current flag.
" Environment, love, health "
" using tax payers money for more important issues, such as feeding our children. #NO-2flagchange"
 not wasting money on changing the flag
" The legends of the Land of The Long White Cloud, the nature and beauty that Aotearoa stands for, the heritage of our ancestors and the stories of New Zealand that we tell our children"
 Public money being spent on things we actually need instead of this flag rubbish. Wake up!!!
 improving my country either by my own impact each and every day or by supporting others. I do not stand for spending such an absolutely insane amount of money to change a flag when WE (as a country) have children who go to school without food in their bellies and WE have housing (state or otherwise) without any decent insulation to name a few things. I stand for not spending tax payers money on wasteful projects such as this.
" truth, equality and sticking to principles. If the Union Jack is removed from the flag, all reference to a treaty between Maori and the British Crown should also be removed from New Zealand's laws and treaty claims terminated."
" Keep it the way it is, change for change sake is the wrong thing. Also, spend money on nz homeless instead of this expensive exercise."

" Identifying ourselves as a proud nation with a unique identity of honestly, equality and freedom."
 Using 26 million to look after people not a flag
 Freedom of choice
 the proud history represented by the present flag. -including the Union Jack The Southern Cross as the main emblem -- gives the Tangata Whenua good standing. Both cultures have given much under this banner. Why replace it?
" Kauri, Kereru and a clean and unpolluted environment. Community and Peace envoys!"
" being proud of being a kiwi. All nz competitors in the modern era of the Olympic Games have competed with a black singlet and a silver fern, be they of chinese, maori, pakeha or any other ethnic background. Our flag should similarly reflect this proud tradition, but not until the last NZ resident WWII veteran has passed on. I represented NZ in Argentina last year and can provide photographic evidence of the Australian and NZ team plaques each having the others flag on it. Not Good.!!"
 environment
" Finding better ways to utilize my tax payer dollar. Affordable housing, child poverty, physical abuse. How can you miss use my tax payer dollar without asking if I even want a new flag? Wasting tax payers dollars on a panel of people to chose a design, make tv paper and radio ads and then say oh but you can still choose to keep the old flag?! How is that progress? How is having a different flag going to address the fact that people are sleeping outside on the streets, children are going to school with no shoes and no lunch and how is it going to protect the innocent from violence? SERIOUSLY"
" Old ladies on buses. A flag is not something you change like a dress or a car. Any change from the current flag will not be recognised in my household. It is however amusing that we have a binding referendum on changing something that doesn't need to be changed, yet the state asset sales was a non binding referendum. Further evidence if evidence was needed that the politicians don't listen. Changing the flag because foreigners can't tell the flag with four red stars is not the same as the Australian flag with yellow stars... what if they can't find New Zealand on the map... is there going to be a referendum to move New Zealand... we could probably buy Greece for a few beads and some feathers..."
 Equality and opportunities
 Not continuing to waste our time and not wasting our tax paying dollars on frivolous matters such as changing the flag! Your publicity adverts are patronising.
 Mutual respect

" A flag that says something about New Zealand's uniqueness. That means no Union flag or Southern Cross which we share with all the Southern Hemisphere. There should be a Maori dimension as our most unique element, but also a fairly simple yet bold flag. A koru symbol in some form would be good. Those complaining about the cost, move on. The referendum is happening so make the most of this opportunity."

" Our History, and while some might no be proud of all of it, it is ours, as is our flag. If there is ever to be a flag change, it needs to be a lot further is the future. This has come at a time of difficult financial stresses for all of NZ, how anyone can justify the exorbitant waste of money I will never understand. I am proud of the monarchy and our NZ flag."

" Leaving the flag as it is, and using the money to feed staving children and supporting the homeless"

 Two great islands and the green fern leaf
 a simple flag which identifies us by using what makes us unique. Half the countries in the world share the Southern Cross and it is on many flags. All countries have ferns and it is difficult to portray a fern which does not look like a white feather. Several countries have significant Polynesian populations. When our service men and women are serving with other forces they use the Kiwi. We call ourselves Kiwis. Because the Kiwi is what makes us unique it should be the main feature of the flag. There are many options for the background colour(s).

" NOT wasting money having a stupid flag suggestion roadshow before we have even found out whether the majority of New Zealanders even want to change the flag. Sorry JK, you got this REALLY wrong. It's, to coin a phrase, arse about face. First referendum should have been, do you want to change the flag. Answer, no, end of expense. Yes, carry on with the current referendum. This strikes me as politically motivated, trying to manipulate the public to choose what JK wants. Shame, as generally, I like him, now I am really disappointed with him, and his government. A sheers waste of 26 million dollars. The road show doesn't seem to be of any interest to the general public, so I think my point is made, comprehensibly."
" excellence, growth, strength and our environment."
 a flag that all New Zealanders can be proud of - one that can be instantly recognised as ours and isn't confused with Australia's or England's.
" a country that does not throw money at politicians who wish to leave behind some sort of legacy. It would be far better to spend the money wasted on a flag debate on other things: eliminating child poverty and abuse, actually spending $$$ on the Christchurch re-build rather than a facade of smoke and mirrors, restoring the High Court in Dunedin etc. I also believe in a country that gives everyone a fair go irrespective of their sex, race etc and a sense of fair play. The latter is not evident in this politician-initiated debate where the sequence of questions has been skewed to get the desired result. I am saddened at the so-called prominent NZers who have agreed to become part of this manufactured debate and taken their pieces of silver."

" Having a flag that represents New Zealand, not our commonwealth affiliation. Because we are not the commonwealth we are New Zealand."
" Maori are special to NZ, living in harmony as a multi cultural society and freedom."
 Peoples freedom of opinion. (We're not ever going to completely agree on 1 design and I stand for history why would we change the flag that our forefathers chose for us. By changing it we lose the history involved in a flag and let's face it this project is merely an attention seeking project.

(4) Our land (clean, green and beautiful). (5) Our history (this could be represented by an aspect of the current flag e.g. the southern cross).

 for my country
" a country that values its Maori community and seeks to ensure they profit equally from our economic success, as well as accepting and valuing our old links to Europe and newer links to the Pacific, Asia, Latin America etc. I also stand for a NZ that fights against consumerism at the expense of our environment (local and global) and allows social inequality to further grow. There is a big opportunity for us to do things differently. Lastly, I stand for a country in which we continue to show generosity to others, especially those sudden and/or dire need, even if they're strangers - this is one of the things that makes NZers, NZers."
" I would like to send in a design but don't know how to do it online but I suggest the new flag doesn't include an emblem which people cannot dscribe or draw. I think it would be far better to have stripes so I suggest horizontal stripes of black, teal blue and snowy white - beautiful and symbolic!!"
" a nation that punches above it's weight in sport, but please we are so much more than sport. Let's have a flag design that does not incorporate the silver fern. That is the icon of the All Blacks and other sports teams and I believe it should stay within that realm. There are a number of designs, particularly with images of the linked koru depicting the islands/long white cloud and the southern cross that are beautiful in their simplicity and depict an inclusive image of a country of strength, culture, heritage, and location."

 The kind of democracy that first asks if I want something to change.
" I feel that we can value how New Zealanders value individuality and personal effort and hard work. We value creativity and appreciate this. I feel the majority of us are honest and laid back, although hard working. I like to think of us as being genuine and not judgemental. I believe that traditionally we value the more simple things in life, and that this is to be valued."
" our traditional image we project to the world ( very successful in light of our standing at the UN and longstanding distinguished contribution to world sports and conflicts,) but updated to distinguish us on the podium alongside the Aussie flag. I suggest our new flag should contain the images on our current flag on a background of turquoise (Pacific Ocean) instead of the current deep blue which confuses others when set alongside the Aussie flag."

" independence, different, unique, independence, independence"
" new zealand has a clean green reputation and is very unspoilt compared to many other countries so a flag with green in it would be great. I liked the little I saw of Dick and Otis Frizzels flags, on TV, and thought they had a fresh light feel to them with a Maori influence, it felt like NZ. I'm a 59yr old pakeha and feel no affiliation to the union jack, not everything has to be about past history, sometimes you need to make new history."
 NZ caring for its people and environment and being a great place to live.
" the protection,repsect and preservation of our beautiful country. The freedom of our people and the upholding of basic human rights. We need a flag that reflects the uniqueness of our land and people."
" Pride in our beautiful land and people and all that makes this place so special. We need a flag which represents 'us', not a relic of a colonial past."
 NZ being an independent country. The flag should be about things that are unique to us.
" protecting our environment, equality, fairness, doing what's right, protecting NZ's uniqueness, being our own nation, making our own decisions, not acting as a scion of any other country. Long term vision not short term profit. Our flag should celebrate symbols that are meaningful to NZers - the southern cross, the silver fern, the koru."
 Unity and strength together as one nation of New Zealanders

" our history and our future. Our country has been forged under this banner. I am proud to be a New Zealander. Not all of our history is positive, however it is who we are. I believe a new design should embrace our past while acknowledging our future - as one New Zealand"
" for a New Zealand that is confident to show a true independence to the world. A country that has broken free of its colonial shackles and is looking to its future in a changing world. A flag change is one of many steps along the way. I was born in the UK, moving to NZ forty-five years ago, like a lot of people looking for a better life. Consider my surprise on arriving to live in my new country that did not have a flag truly representing its self, but sharing with another country. When the NZ flag is raised around the world do people instantly think NZ or perhaps Great Britain, as it is the Union Jack which is more recognizable. Sure we have history with GB, history doesn't change but times do. The old allegiances have changed with GB now in the EU, people we fought against in two worlds, have more rights in GB than New Zealanders. Take the first step and change the flag."

 history
" the responsible use by government of taxpayer funds, on such areas as worthwhile developmental infrastructure and support for the disadvantaged. Expenditure of $26,000,000 on an unnecessary flag referendum is a grossly irresponsible waste of money, and I call upon the Government to immediately withdraw the concept, and to consign it to the dustbin, where it belongs."
" Continued recognition of our national pride from our heritage days, forged through the lives of many who have served and died under our current flag. To change the flag is to restart our heritage. We do not need this."

 South Australia.
 a NZ that recognises its polynesian forefathers who lived here well before the british colony. I stand for a flag that honours our pacific past more than our british past. The current NZ flag reminds me of the mistreatment of maori and pacific peoples through the English command. A new flag would display NZ's new direction in accepting that we were destined to be a Pacific and diverse nation.

" Our History, I am proud of it and love the flag we have now.. My Father and various relatives fought under this flag in two world wars and to me it truly represents who we are and reminds me of our past... It would be nothing short of vandalism to try to replace it.. This whole exercise is a stupid and futile waste of our money!!"

A view not tethered to, or encumbered by, racially or regionally motivated (or even, solely or principally, nation- focused) patriotism. I do not agree with resorting to the tools of political despots, such as using flags and other national insignia as 'overt symbols of patriotism', whether or not that is intended to create pride in our country. It runs counter to what I stand for and, as history has shown, is capable of being used to justify gross breaches of human rights. That stance does not exclude having pride in being part of a country that adheres to and promotes such values. Flags and other insignia should be treated merely as convenient means of recognition for certain purposes- nothing more."

I don't want to lose our southern cross on the flag, I like the colours of red, white and blue (some heritage) , I like a Koru or some other Maori design (also our heritage). There was a flag designed by a young designer in Chch - I quite liked that. Until then I could not imagine an alternative flag but I was so impressed by that.

Changing the flag is a needlessly expensive business and I would rather the money was spent on positive initiatives in education or poverty reduction."

" The current flag as it accurately portrays our western cultural history which is responsible for the NZ we have today our standards, our life style, our democratic law process, all based on a best practices process fine tuned over many years of international participation The actual meanings of the individual components of our flag need to be upheld and discussed Everthing from the actual colours meanings, placement, line widths, bands, cross styles and star pattern If the Govt is determined to change the flag then the current one needs to be incorporated within any new design A black flag is not acceptable under any circumstance Historically black being a sign of death and defeat!"
 not changing the New Zealand flag think it is a dumb idea and I think that you people are idiots for wanting to change it
 Heritage and tradition - remembering the endeavours of our forefathers in making this country what it is. My flag would include aspects of the union jack and our southern cross stars... in fact not too dissimilar to the present flag!
" If New Zealand where a fully united country with no divide between the cultures particular Maori and Pakeha (and for that matter all other ethnic group's, than we can have a new flag embracing all people living in NZ. At the moment its a whim of one or a few, consumed by this idea. We are not even have a National day to celebrate all of us living in New Zealand. Waitangi Day surly is not a national day embracing all. Please get priority's right Led the way to unite us all to stand together under one flag, when we are becoming a republic!"

 not wasting money on redesigning a flag when the money could be better spent elsewhere... 2 children killed in Christchurch in the last 6 weeks... surely spending money addressing this problem is more important than wasting money on a flag.
" A prosperous NZ, which is why I disagree with the government spending up to 26 million on a flag when NZ has serious poverty, low incomes and starving children. Sort out our priorities. A new flag is not it."
 the current union jack is the only flag I will ever recognise - my family has a proud military history from WW1 fighting for freedom. Why was not a referendum held to first establish if NZers actually wanted a new flag instead of the government bulldozing ahead with a costly exercise sourcing/deciding on final designs. The millions of dollars cost involved could well be better spent on the needs of 1000's of deserving NZers.

There are always and always will be the two main cultures that make what Aotearoa is today. Although I do say that what a waste of money to spend on changing a flag. if it's to be changed it should be shared between the two Cultures that uphold both Maori and Pakeha because this is Aotearoa and whether we like it or not We are Aotearoa.

" using the 34m more wisely then to change the flag, use it to feed the homeless, shelter the poor, care for the sick and elderly, donate to developing countries so they can have clean water, food, proper shelters and health.Huge letdown when all people want to do is change the flag when we can use it for more important things."

 NZ is special to me for our proud history. I stand for our existing flag. I stand for referendums that are binding on our government and I stand for parents to have the right to smack their kids to enforce discipline.
 honesty

 Leave our flag as it is. I will turn my back on any other design
 Keeping the current flag as it is we do not need to change and waste money spend the money on our health and education systems instead
 What my grandparents fought for! K.O.F my grandfathers fought for this country and this flag listen to our kiwis wanting to kof!! Spend money on more important things....... Cheers a proud kiwi!

" Christian values and ethics of; love, compassion, justice, responsibilities and accountabilities to others and to a creator, God. I stand for staying connected to the British Commonwealth, which brought the Christian values, ethics and world view to these shores, which when applied correctly, as they have been for the greater part over the last 170 plus years, has built this nation into a first world nation. I stand for a New Zealand that will continue to stand on Christian beliefs and values of equality of men and women, of freedom from sin that hurts one self and others, of freedom of speech, of faith that God is, and that we can. I stand for the Christian ethics of work, industry and reward. And a fair distribution of God's blessing on the nation and on businesses. Finally I will stand with God against New Zealand if we turn from his ways, yet in our arrogance still expect him to defend New Zealand."

 Having a flag that is unique and individual as our country
" equal opportunities for all, especially for our children, regardless of race or income. I stand for conserving our flora and fauna -- without the species unique to New Zealand, we are a much diminished country. I stand for the fair settlement of Treaty of Waitangi grievances -- let's put right the wrongs of the past and move forward. I stand for clean and green -- the way I would like to leave our country to our children."

 Leaving the flag as it is. And giving school and family's that can't afford food clothing and bills a hand. I stand for making this place better by spending the money on something that will make a difference. But we won't get a say because the flag will still happen and kids will still starve.

 NZ and its history. It's history is our flag. Why spend millions changing it when that money could be spent on children. They are our future. A new flag is going to do what?
 Keeping the flag the same and spending the money on health or education
 Respecting the current flag as I think that the flag isn't something you can just go and change... think of what important historic moments have happened under our current flag
" Silver Fern, Southern Cross, Black"
 Not changing the flag
" All New Zealanders coming together behind a new identity. For this to happen, those who want to retain the current flag and those like me who wish to having nothing but the silver fern, will need to compromise. Without compromise, standoff remains. A compromise flag will keep the greatest number of NZers happy. The above flag reaches a good compromise. The southern cross from the current flag, red colour for mana so important to Maori, the silver fern - unique to NZ and as recognisable with NZ as the maple leaf is to Canada, and black - our national colour. Such a flag would never be confused with that of another nations. How good would it look when hoisted to our national anthem at a medal ceremony when we win gold at the Rio Olympics in 2016..."
" a multi-cultural country that has stood up for democracy and freedom, and respects all citizens. A country that is innovative, sporting and fair. A beautiful and diverse landscape with clear skys waterways."

" I stand for unity in diversity. Our country has changed remarkably over the past 25 years and we now have an extremely diverse population. Our current flag doesn't reflect the current and future status of this nation anymore. We need a flag that respects the past, celebrates our diversity and unites us as New Zealanders! We need a flag that stands out among the nations flags so we can passionately fly it instead of flying the fern flag at international sports events. Isn't this proof our current flag is defunct? Let us be noticed rather than being identified for what we are not. Perhaps this all is why so many are indifferent about our current flag. A bold new flag design will ignite the passion and we will show how proud we are being New Zealanders."

People don't realise they would be opening a Pandora's box if they changed the flag and the way they viewed our country.

 Changing the current flag and making the new flag ours. The current flag is made up of the British flag and the southern cross.

We are our own people, we make our own laws and do things our way. we are not in the pocket of any other country. We are uniquely us. Our flag needs to be unique and reflect our pride in being New Zealanders. Although some people may say our current flag is the one people fought and died under, that was in the past, and ""the past is a foreign country"". We can have a new flag now that reflects the new century, and the country we are now, not the country we were 70 years ago. We have come a long way since the last war, and we can hold our head up high when we consider all the great achievements New Zealanders are now making in sport, music, arts, science and innovation, in fact in every sphere of endeavour New Zealanders are making significant progress and often are world leaders in their field. A new flag needs to reflects our pride in our country and the great thinks Kiwis can do."
" all the people who no longer have a voice. They lived, and they died, while fighting for our freedom, fighting for our democracy, fighting for our independence, fighting for OUR COUNTRY. Have some respect for these hero's who saluted our current flag. These hero's who protected our shores. These hero's who paid the ultimate price for US. I will speak for these hero's.

You could always spot a kiwi because they had a silver fern sticker on their car...not an NZ flag. Fellow New Zealanders weren't called Maori, PI or European...we were all Kiwis. It's funny what you miss about home. The land, the soft friendly people, the culture diversity and acceptance. The sense of belonging. You realize that NZ is uniquely different from Oz and the UK. Perspective - I now treasure our culture and our national anthem. A place where people care about others...home."

We want to stand out and be seen. Black isn't even a colour. While many people are saying to use a silver fern on our flag, I think such a design can not be easily replicated. The flag needs to be able to be made into small images. The flags of many other countries get altered due to too much detail, for example the Brazil flag hardly ever is shown in its true form. Do we want our flag to be shown incorrectly all the time?"
" having a unified approach to re-branding our country. Our nation's name, colonial status and anthem should all be up for discussion too!"

Why waste money on changing a flag. It's disrespectful to the armed force who went to war and lost or risked loosing there lives under our flag."

 empathy
 culture
 neither the union flag nor the southern cross are uniquely NZ. (Croix du sud elsewhere in Pacific). Time to embrace the Maori flag -with colours strongly identified with culture of Aotearoa - perhaps with a silver fern superimposed. (But something which looks more like a silver fern and less like a white feather!) But why does it cost so much to get there?
 history
" faith, hope and love. i do love our flag, my father served in WW2, so it is important to me. But, I think we need to be different from Australia, our flags are too much alike."
 New Zealand and our history our peace and unity.
" a clear, new, recognizable symbol for New Zealand... one which represents ALL the country and not any one ethnicity. Therefore a plant could be a refreshing and clean-cut symbol(the popularity of the Canadian flag is an obvious example).As for the Union Jack,we did not fight 2 World Wars for a FLAG; we fought to keep our country free. We do, however, need to get away from the current confusion with the Australian flag.... it just plain embarrassing.To this end I suggest a simple fern design in bright green or silver on a shaded blue background. Alternatively it could be a black fern on a white background with a green border to represent our ""clean green"" image. The fern is an internationally recognised NZ symbol but the flag's colours must not be confused with the All Blacks' insignia. Above all the flag must be imaginative and not a mish-mash to try to keep various interest groups happy - as this will ultimately result in a general backlash at voting time with a rejection of the new idea in favour of the old flag."

" We must not be seduced into supposing that the silver fern is representative of the nation. As it is currently used, this symbol is a brand, denoting âNZ Ltdâ. It represents only commercial activity, notably trade, sport and tourism. New Zealand society is much richer than a narrow focus on these activities would imply and I believe the flag should reflect a broader view of our diverse society, embodying the land, the origin of its peoples and our distinctively bicultural ethos."

" 1)Not spending ridiculous amounts of money on this flag white wash while children in NZ are in worsening rates of poverty, no pretty flag will make us look like a great nation if we treat our young with so little care. 2) Climate Change is a game changer and this government needs to pay more attention to it not sistract us with a flag debate. 3)We also need more time and focus on these various international treaties being negotiated in secret that will effect our livelihood and our sovereignty: the TTPA (the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement) and the TiSA (Trade in Services Agreement). While this flag debate gets millions and mainstream media laps it up, MSM only just touches on the issues of these major events that our government is planning to full heartedly support without any debate. What's the point of a pretty flag if we have no ability to hold multinational companies to account over how they behave in our country because our laws cannot check them???"

The image I've put on below is copied from the flags on nzgovt website and not my design, but think something like that one would be perfect."
 New Zealand 
" as an Australian, i think NZ should significantly alter their flag to distinguish it from the next door neighbour's flag. And, i think my home country should change their flag to make it distinctive from the NZ flag and the Union Jack. The NZ flag should be a symbol of an entire country not just a minority or majority ethnic group. To that end i would suggest a strong leaning toward a simple southern element such as a Crux or a southern light."
" Accountability, Honesty and Kindness. I also feel strongly that non-citizens should not have a say in our flag."
 Keeping the flag the same and spending the saved money on fixing the terrible state of some schools in NZ. I believe we stand for action and making ourselves worthy of the current flag and southern cross.

 the OLD flag that my grandfather and great uncles fought and died for. Spending millions changing it while families struggle to pay their bills is a disgrace to those whose blood stained the killing fields protecting our nation.
 keeping the same flag.NZ was founded by the principals of the United Kingdom with both European and Maori joining together as one nation.My father served both the WW1 and WW2 (served NZ for 10 years in both wars) declaring his allegiance to our flag to protect all future generations. The flag serves as a reminder to all my family of his loyal devotion to New Zealand.
" My fallen whanau and their companions., Keep our flag as it is!"
" keeping our current flag. It has flown over many moments throughout New Zealand's history. It does not matter that it is similar to Australia's flag, there are other countries who share similarities with other countries flags too. Educate yourself if you find it hard to identify between the two. Our flag represents our ties with England, of which I am proud. Keep our flag and stop dictating over the people of New Zealand."
" Dear friends, I don't know whether you have given much thought to the current efforts and publicity around reviewing or changing our NZ flag. I know I hadn't until recently and until Jack Tame on TV1 interviewed about 60 random people in Times Square, New York. Some were Americans but many were of various nationalities including a couple of Kiwis and a couple of Aussies. Jack showed them all a large New Zealand flag and asked them what country it represented. A couple said France, a few said the UK (because of the Union Jack in the corner) but the majority said Australia. Only the Kiwis and the Aussies picked it as the NZ flag. Some days ago I completed a Colmar Brunton poll on-line concerning the NZ flag and the questions asked got me thinking. I have done some surveying of my own around the world and I have found no-one that can pick the NZ flag out of a selection of flags. It is a sad fact that our current flag is identified internationally, everywhere except in New Zealand and Australia as the Australian flag. I don't know about you but I seriously resent being identified as an Australian and having my country identified as Australia through our national flag.. As a proud Kiwi I am sincerely concerned about this and I would like to see a NZ flag that can be easily, clearly and positively identified world-wide as definitely and uniquely New Zealand especially at sporting events such as the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, rowing "
 To keep the old flag
" not having to erxplain tgo everybody overseas that the silver fern is not a feather. I travel a lot and have conducted straw polls in the street in New York, London, LA, Paris, Singapore, Nagasaki and Bordeaux, Cassino Italy asking people on the street to identify what a silver fern is. The overwhelming response is 85% say a white feather. Not only is it a white feather but that is associated in the western world with cowardice. People say that the current flag is too close to Australia's flag - that's because we are close in many ways to Australia and that in most ways is real good. A unique relationship between two sovereign countries that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world - status quo for me!"

" NOT CHANGING THE FLAG: People complain about it, and how it is too much like the Australian flag. This is incorrect, theirs is like ours. The New Zealand Flag has always flown over me and my comrades, during our service and while working overseas. To change this Historical Heirloom is to spit in the face of our history. To change this flag, is to make all those who have achieve and succeed in the face adversity, while flying our flag is too cheapen their success. WHY waste $26 million Dollars, on something that 80% New Zealanders don't want? This shows me how corrupt our government has become and I am disgusted. So when you do get your way. Because you have ignore the New Zealand people in the past. I won't be flying, or serving under your consumer, throw away trash of a flag, I will be flying the one that me, my family, and friends have served and died for!!

We should still keep the Union Jack though because that shows we are a part of the Commonwealth. Without originality our flag would not be unique and it would be very similar to other flags. This is why I stand for originality and why I believe we should change some of the flag so it doesn't look so much like Australia."

I want to do this because before humans where here the animals could live in freedom and now they can't. We as New Zealanders should make a pest free place for them. Without this we will eventually have no native animals. So this is what I stand for. New Zealand native animals."

" freedom, equality and anti-corruption"
 not dropping 1080 and killing our animals in our country. I stand for not dropping 1080 because if we keep dropping it then all the animals will become extinct. another reason is if we dont stop it then people wont be able to go hunting and buy pets from the pet shop and play with them. we could change this by getting all of the helicopter pilots to stop dropping it then we wont have to worry about the native animals dying in the wild.
" Freedom and peace. Without freedom and peace in New Zealand we wouldn't be able to choose our career or live where we want to live, although in some countries they don't decide, so the come to New Zealand. I stand for peace because living in a peaceful environment means there is little conflict or rivalry. Freedom make New Zealand a better place to live. I stand for this because New Zealand would be different than it is today."
" My culture because we were the second to New Zealand and to eat, drink and sleep on our land."

We need to trap these introduced pests that are still out there killing our birds. When you have children would you want them to see our birds? We can do this by not keeping pet cats and setting traps. Without these birds we would not be unique. Endemic birds are very unique and are special to new Zealand and that is why I stand for them.

" It is a disgrace and an insult to have another country's flag on ours. Especially when that country supports unjustified wars, torture and colonial exploitation. It is one of several physcopathic countries that have nuclear weapons and preparations to use them. In the name of our own freedom I want the union jack off our flag. I stand for equality and economic egalitarianism. I stand for respect for our ecology, environment and want the needs of citizens to be above the desires of businesses."

 Our flag a has many parts including the cross which reminds us of the Scots heritage of many of our people but which also refers to the faith many of the original settlers brought with them and which the Maori tribes grasped freely as their own. If we leave the cross out of the flag we do away with much of what I stand for and many others like me because my Christian faith is the most important thing in my life. So please make a little space for the cross too or leave the flag as it is. God is still important to the survival of this nation.

So need to keep the union jack part but get rid of the 4 stars and replace with silver fern, or keep silver fern but have on blue background.

Personally I favour the Green and black design with the silver fern and the southern cross both because they are part of who we are. The silver fern is recog- nised globally and I like the green as it goes with our clean green image. Canada's flag is instantly recognizable since they ditched the Union Jack part and simplified the design and I think we should do something similar. At the moment we are too close to the Australian flag and need our own representing both the European and Maori part of our heritage. Clean, Green, Black, Silver Fern and Southern Cross."

" our uniqueness, independence and solidarity as one people in the world. I think there is no better representation of our uniqueness, independence and unity than the Silver Fern. A simple Silver Fern on a black background is my STRONG preference if we are to change flags. I really don't want our flag changed if it resembles a cluttered schoolkid's social studies project just for us to satisfy people's desire for it to be ""all-encompassing"" and ""inclusive"" - it's simply not possible to put a symbol to cater to every last person's sensibilities and even if we do it only reinforces divisions in society. The fern binds and unites us all under ONE symbol. I also don't buy into arguments that a black flag is too closely related to ISIS. If ISIS had chosen green and gold and Australia were to change their flag then it would be irrelevant what ISIS had chosen. Australia's national colours are green and gold just as ours is black. It sets us apart. The Silver Fern is already universally recognised internationally and domestically as unequivocally ""Kiwi""; more so than any other symbol. A simple flag with the Silver Fern on a black background will be as iconic as the Canadian maple leaf and I would proudly fly it anywhere in the world. Our WWI and WW2 troops are buried under a simple fern in Europe, it's a symbol of excellence in sports and, simply, it is us. Please make the Silver Fern on a black background one of the 4 short-listed options. Kind regards, Craig "

I stand for a country that focuses on preserving those things and finding new initiatives to share with the world.

I wish that the Union Jack will remain in the flag, to sustain our entitlement of appeal to British Justice. I submit this flag design, not of my own making, but of my preferred option on the following basis: It is bold and recognisable. It is easy to draw. It combines NZ's heritage (Maori culture, Natural Environment) with the colonial pact that represents NZ's unique story of establishment on the global stage. I believe these are factors of utmost importance in the design of a national identity for this country. I also like it's visual appeal, and I think it can easily replace the existing flag while pleasing all people who stand for good things.

" a unique, remote set of islands, with an ever diversifying population that results in original, independent people. Our flag must be memorable, simple, easy to replicate (children love drawing the flag), and should avoid the confusion of multiple symbology (e.g.,. fern + southern cross). The silver fern is already an image that is internationally recognised. It holds a cultural symbolism that resonates with both maori, pakeha and new migrants alike. On the other hand, the southern cross (or a version of it) is already relied upon by other nations. A constellation of astronomical objects (the southern cross) does not define the land in which we live, it is simply something that can be clearly seen from here. It is not unique to New Zealand."

" Sir/Madam This letter represents the thoughts of six middle-aged gentlemen, albeit from different walks of life. We are international travelers; holiday-makers, sportspeople and businessmen and yet we are and always will be loyal New Zealanders. We believe that it is time for NZ to have a new flag. In our experience, there have been too many instances of foreigners, after seeing our flag think we are Australian, whether we succeed in sport or business. We believe New Zealand has evolved to be a self-managing country and no longer should be seen to be under the symbol of the United Kingdom, especially when parts of the UK itself are seeking independence. We wish to comment of the NZ flag redesign. 1. We wish to see a flag that defines us as New Zealanders 2. It needs to have impact. 3. It needs to be of a simple design, not cluttered by too many features 4. We see that simplicity with demonstrate power and recognition 5. It needs to be recognised as our flag by nationals of other countries 6. It should recognise our past and future 7. It should work as a brand or international symbol 8. Be applicable across multiple platforms and applications 9. Be iconic. We recommend a silver fern on a blue background. We think justification for the fern is self-evident but the blue represents the South Pacific. Black carries many negative connotations globally, from the old world to the new. Regards Hob's Nobs"

And then people will have a better understanding why you are changing the flag. WHY? Or John keys WHAT? Usually in nature or peoples minds there becomes a need for change like food supplies running out / survival / sex / territory etc... Sure we have risk takers in the ""herd"" and that is how the human race has got to where we are now, but it's not risk taking for no reason... And that is why this whole flag debate is a chambles... Because people have not been shown a need for it (or are not being told) (or feel they were never asked) No wonder you are getting resistance... and/or they don't see the potential. People need real reasons for change!!! The sooner you give people ideas like this the sooner you will have a new flag! I am naturally a risk taker and I do not mind if we change our flag. (How about a plain white towel flag) ;-) I see it would be good that the NZ brand is instantly recognizable and stands out on a world scale. But I hope we don't become a uniform branded country run by ""brawndo""...(idiocracy). ""I like moonnneyy"".. we hopefully get more than that out of this flag change. Unless someone can give me more information. Unification of our branding as a country? sure why not? But black on a flag means death so I think we need to be careful. WHY? / WHAT do we get out of this. Identify the need? - I'm not wanting answers like to give our country an identity or to represent all NZers etc) I've already herd that! I want to know do we become an independent country? OrÂ we get more trade benefits with China etc...

Our flag should consist of these items (fern arched across the diagonal with a kiwi in the bottom outer corner) both in white on a black or blue background.

" The Flag What the hotch potch of PC propagandised citizens including a myriad recent immigrants individually stand for is barely relevant. Most in the current era stand for themselves, many stand for blatant opportunism and exploitation , many just for NZ sporting supremacy, many for a life of gross indulgence, many for a career on welfare, many for maori separatism and supremacy, many for their own external and recently introduced culture, many for islamic principles.etc. It is what the flag stands for which matters. Where what the past population stood for had major and beneficial and conscionable influence, and major sacrifice was made to achieve, then what that population stood for should carry greater weight than the muddled and mixed moods of the present coddled population. Leave the flag as is. Flags should represent heritage unless this is somehow grossly flawed. Ours is not. By world standards our development has been highly principled. Even maori have been very well treated by the standards of the time, particularly their own. The persons most entitled to vote on the flag are the generations gone. Those who pioneered and strove to develop NZ in the British image. It is often claimed that NZ soldiers over the decades fought for freedom not a flag. That may have been part of the official line, and a major factor in WW2, but pride in the Empire was a huge motivation. If Germany had triumphed in the WW1 it is unlikely the freedom or life of the ordinary NZer would have much altered from pre war. But pride in Empire would have been shattered. Books for youths and school texts placed enormous emphasis on the British Empire, on its history of proud achievement, and the duty to protect it. The current generation has little appreciation of the sentiments of the time. The thousands who died and fought were largely motivated by considerations of Empire and duty to. At the time represented by the existing flag. The young , taught by teachers themselves ignorant, have almost no knowledge of our past European heritage. In honour of the tens of thousands who died and the many more whose lives were seriously affected we must preserve the flag. How they would have voted, weighted for population of the time, must be considered. Probably 90% for retention. The existing flag is soundly based. The blue represents our maritime isolation. The southern cross our location, in a way shared by only a small proportion of the inhabited globe. The Union Jack in one corner is entirely appropriate. The whole basis of our society is the legal and democratic system developed by England and it is appropriate that this is recognised. Even the Treaty and the current elevation and exaggerated recognition of stems from that. We do not need symbols of our stone age past, or separatist agitation. We do not need a blind blundering flightless kiwi. Nor do we need a silver fern which looks like a fish skeleton (appropriate though this may be in view of ravaged stocks). The heritage of the great majority of persons who significantly developed this country to its present form is that of the British people. To change the flag to represent the PC whimsy of a coddled generation and a multitude of recent arrivals who played little or no part in the development or preservation of our basic ideals will be a monstrous betrayal. Sadly there are few left to represent the old soldiers. The RSA is seen as an irrelevant assortment of old codgers. Those most likely to show concern, sons and daughters of soldiers, are now also elderly. The arduous task of preparing and presenting strong well worded argument is beyond most. It is swamped by the trivial flood from the twitter generation. The huge emphasis on Internet information and polling effectively excludes many of the older generation whose views should count for so much. Sadly, I appreciate all the above is wasted. The commission has been set up and will not abdicate the well paid positions even if the public is hugely opposed to change. Similarly, the government will not rescind its decision and lose face. To avoid criticism of squandered expenditure every effort will be made to encourage present day majority support for a different flag, A reasoned view as above from a knowledgeable citizen is counted as one vote for one view. It ranks no higher than the frivolous off the cuff tweet from some immature low IQ youth with no or broad knowledge or experience of the past, coasting along on welfare, and likely with an anti NZ establishment attitude."
 Rememdering our fallen soldiers and the flag they fought under.
 the current flag and not wasting money.
 not changing the flag. I stand for using the $26 million on something else other than the flag.
 for what people actually want and need that is to leave the flag as it and put that money to better use like improving public transport or child poverty!

" democracy. We said NO! Government not listening to the wishes of the people. If someone confuses us with the Aussie flag then put them straight; its a great opportunity to promote this wonderful country! We don't need to change the flag to be great. This is the thin edge of wedge to move to a republic. Wake up people, its only political manipulation."

 The southern cross and the union jack; for our current flag and no other! I stand against ignorant politicians who do not want to hear what we the people think. I stand against destructive governance and heinous money wasting.

" Sir/Madam This letter represents the thoughts of six middle-aged gentlemen, albeit from different walks of life. We are international travelers; holiday-makers, sportspeople and businessmen and yet we are and always will be loyal New Zealanders. We believe that it is time for NZ to have a new flag. In our experience, there have been too many instances of foreigners, after seeing our flag think we are Australian, whether we succeed in sport or business. We believe New Zealand has evolved to be a self-managing country and no longer should be seen to be under the symbol of the United Kingdom, especially when parts of the UK itself are seeking independence. We wish to comment of the NZ flag redesign. 1. We wish to see a flag that defines us as New Zealanders 2. It needs to have impact. 3. It needs to be of a simple design, not cluttered by too many features 4. We see that simplicity with demonstrate power and recognition 5. It needs to be recognised as our flag by nationals of other countries 6. It should recognise our past and future 7. It should work as a brand or international symbol 8. Be applicable across multiple platforms and applications 9. Be iconic. We recommend a silver fern on a blue background. We think justification for the fern is self-evident but the blue represents the South Pacific. Black carries many negative connotations globally, from the old world to the new. Regards Hob's Nobs"

 Democracy. And this process is not democracy. It spits in the face of every Kiwi that went overseas and died for this country. And their families. Democracy will ask at the next elections IF we want to change our flag YES or NO answer. Then decide. This 27 million can save countless lives. This is just a legacy project for somebody whose head is just a tad to big. And ignoring these messages from most kiwis will cost national dearly at the next elections.

In the lower left hand corner a soft brown Kiwi emerges from a clump of silver ferns. He or she looks up at a silver Southern Cross (right hand side upper corner). The left hand edge of the flag is edged with the same colours as the decoration QSM/QSO (to recognise the Maori people (the tangata whenua)). Now that would be a flag the majority of us might be willing to have stand for us.

 A country which came about as the result of the second settlers of the country agreeing to cede their sovereignty to the UK reigning monarch in return for the protection of the Crown and the same rights as British citizens.
" In his recent address to the Members Annual Dinner at the Wellington Club, Sir Richard Taylor was invited to make some observations on the forthcoming flag debate. His response was that a national flag should represent the place and the people, their story and their vision. My response is to present a view on the current flag which has fulfilled this role for 100 years. For me the Union Flag, upper left, is not to be seen in terms of a colonial past. We have evolved to be a sovereign independent nation. Her Majesty, though Head of State, effectively acts through the Governor-General, who is nominated by Parliament, serving a five year term. The Union flag is to be seen as a symbol of something far deeper. This was the flag which lay upon the table when the Treaty was signed beginning at Waitangi in 1840. That flag symbolised and guaranteed that the two parties were embarking on a relationship which would be one of good will, justice, integrity and peace. This was a moment when European and Polynesian cultures came together to express their rights, their promises, their obligations and respect for one another. The fact that it was signed on the Union flag was a guarantee of substance. It has a place on our flag just as that Treaty has a place in our society. The four stars of the Southern Cross also express something of our common past. Everyone, from Kupe to Cook, came to this country and navigated their way by the stars. Such techniques are even in a time of highly accurate alternatives still taught to seafarers and aircrew. These two elements sit on a sea of blue. Our island nation is surrounded by sea. Everyone, from whatever culture, whether forebear or new citizen, has crossed that sea. The sea provides resources and pleasure. It is a colour truly expressive of our people. Sir Richard's observation is highlighted in the flag we now possess. It represents our history, our values, the virtues of which we are proud. It also represents in quiet dignity, our cultural union. It also challenges us to renew this vision for as long as this nation exists."

" National flag somehow ârepresentsâ a nation. Many countries have some symbols, texts or shapes associated with them. On this basis NZ flag has Union Jack and Southern Cross on it. I understand that the government wants to make the flag easily recognizable around the world, and, to show our independence, throwing away the Union Jack. Quite successfully, Canada did it 50 years ago. Maple leaf become a symbol of that country easily recognizable around the world. Our leaders are pushing for sliver fern. I do not think it is a very good idea. In many countries (especially in Europe) silver fern leaf (especially on black) is associated with funeral services. So, what about a kiwi bird? It is a native bird, shape is already known around the world and associated with New Zealand. Why not to have the new flag similar to the NZ air forces insignia?"

" David Mabbot's design, but with modification. 1. Since black is the national colour of New Zealand, the New Flag should have black in the background, 2. If the Flag has half black background, why not adding blue stars, because it represent the natural environment; the night with blue stars in dark sky. It creates natural pleasure to human visual sense. 3. Reduce the flag colours to 3, which are blue, black and white, the simplicity is better for flag design. Thus, there is no need for red colour in NZ flag, we're not communist state, red only create visual disturbance to our eyes."

 The triple star! 3 kete were brought down from heaven. They contained 3 stars. The 1st star was the star of light- everything that is good and beautiful -everything worth protecting and holding on to. The 2nd kete contained the star of darkness. This is the knowledge of what you hold on to as you walk through hard and dark times. This is your anchor. The 3rd kete of knowledge contained the star of love. This star is when you realise that you have a gift of yourself that is meant for other people. We were made for community. We are a people who love. This is NZ. This is my country. These are the people who hold the land for the next generation.

" Keeping the flag as it is. It is well designed well known through most of the world. It stands for exactly what NZ is. The union jack and the southern star says it all. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"""
" No change, if it isn't broke don't fix it. The current flag has served generations well and is recognized and respected internationally. The flag along with all forms of heraldry reflects historical symbolism, blue for the ocean, southern cross for location and the union jack reflects the founding association of our country in the international community. NZ has plenty of ills that do need attention so we need concentrate efforts were the expenditure will do the most good, not on something that the majority appears not to want ( I am disappointed that our PM has gone off track with this whim) As a point of interest, the comment that our flag looks too similar to that of Australia should be rephrased to Australia's is too similar to NZ's. NZ's flag was first. Check it out. As for a black background to a flag--- Black is a negative emoting colour."

 A New Zealand which will not stand for the poor of our country being taken advantage of by the very government departments charged with protecting them. That means a country of equality for all and jobs for all who can work and equal wage rises for the bottom of the wage ladder with the top of the wage ladder. Our new flag should represent the fact that this country was owned by Maori and it time the union jack was removed and replaced by a Maori icon in recognition of their status.

" a realistic view of NZ today. This is best represented by the Kyle Lockwood variations with his use of the silver fern. It was good enough to be put on my Dad's headstone at El Alamein, along with the headstones of all the other Kiwi soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice. The silver fern is also used as the suspender of the NZ War Service medal and is also incorporated on the NZ Memorial Cross, awarded to the next of kin of all those who died while serving their country. I believe the colours used, the central position of the silver fern and the placement of the stars of the southern cross all add up to a most meaningful and enduring symbol of our wonderful country."

They endured poverty far, far worse than what we hear of today. True pioneers these people were, to change their lives for the better and break out from the awful lives they had in the British isles. The legacy they built was building a new nation, that nation now needs it's own flag to show it's national identity."

" History and learning. The following is for all those aposed to changing our flag, learn from Canada's history....... The Great Flag Debate Canadians respond with passion and dissension as the country seeks a new national symbol In 1963, Canada embarked on a seemingly harmless attempt to create its own flag but the issue revealed a nation hotly divided on what symbol should unite the country. The parliamentary debate on Canada's proposed flag was lengthy and ugly. Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson eventually used the rules of closure to limit speeches to 20 minutes and force a vote on December 15, 1964. Pictured here, members of Parliament with the proposed flag. (National Archives of Canada, PA-142624) At the time, Canada had existed for 96 years and still did not have a flag to call its own. Since Confederation, the Canadian national flag had been the British Union Jack - a symbol of Canada's former colonial status. The Red Ensign - a modified version of the flag of the British merchant fleet - also was used atop the flag poles of the nation. In 1963, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson pitched his idea for a new flag during a speech to the Canadian Legion in Winnipeg. ""I believe that today a flag designed around the Maple Leaf, will symbolise and be a true reflection of the new Canada."" As boos resonated throughout the audience, Pearson got a glimpse of the controversy he'd unleashed. Instead of uniting the country, the flag became yet another divisive issue. Support, laments and threats poured in to Pearson's office as the country debated its flag. ""If this is (Pearson's) idea of unity,"" read an article in the Vancouver Province, ""it is doubtful whether the country can swallow much more of it."" In 1964, Canadians were deeply divided on the flag issue. Some Canadians felt a strong attachment to the British Union Jack and other wanted a new symbol for the country. One flag design proposed three maple leaves. Pictured here, student flag demonstration on Parliament Hill. (National Archives of Canada, PA-151866) Canadians were deeply divided on the flag issue. Some felt a strong attachment to the mother country and its Union Jack. Others disagreed on what new symbol should represent the country. It was only in Quebec that the flag issue provoked little more than apathy. ""Quebec does not give a tinkers dam about the new flag,"" Liberal politician Pierre Trudeau said. ""Its a matter of complete indifference."" It was in a charged atmosphere that Parliament began the flag debate, lead by Conservative leader John Diefenbaker. He insisted that the Union Jack be incorporated into the new flag to reflect Canadas British heritage. The Liberals and New Democratic Party wanted something with maple leaves. Canadians were invited to use their imagination and talent and submit ideas for a flag. As many as 5,900 alternative designs were sent to Ottawa. A 15-member all-party committee was formed to review the suggestions and make a recommendation. Pearsons preferred design of three maple leaves was finally rejected in favour of a design proposed by the historian George Stanley that featured a single leaf flanked by red bars. Diefenbaker dismissively said that it looked like the Peruvian flag. Canadians were invited to use their imagination and talent and submit ideas for a new flag. As many as 5,900 alternative designs were sent to Ottawa. (National Archives of Canada) The parliamentary debate on the flag was lengthy and ugly. It consumed 37 sitting days: the Conservatives made 210 speeches, the Liberals 50, the NDP 24, Social Credit 15, and the CrÃ©ditistes 9. Pearson eventually used the rules of closure to limit speeches to 20 minutes and force a vote. That vote was taken on December 15, 1964 and the committee's recommendation was accepted 163 to 78. Canada's flag was officially hoisted at the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill on February 15, 1965. ""You have done more to divide the country than any other prime minister,"" Diefenbaker charged. When Diefenbaker died in 1979, his coffin was draped with both the Red Ensign and the new flag. However, Canada's new flag was generally well received by the public. The large generation of Canadians born after the Second World War took to the country's new symbol. The government used Canada's 100th anniversary celebrations in 1967 to promote the new flag throughout the country."
" NOT wasting $26m on changing our flag but instead spending it on feeding our children, insulating cold and damp homes, helping people get into their first home or anything that will actually HELP our people. Please please don't spend another dollar on this referendum but if it does go ahead the question about whether we want to change at all needs to be asked FIRST!!!"
" The silver fern. The southern cross. Black because it is what our sportspeople wear. Please don,t put a koru etc as though that is an attractive symbol it is reflective of one culture and I don,t think the flag should be weighted towards any particular culture but rather represent all of us. Green and blue are also good colours for the sea and land. The blue if included should be the same shade as our current flag as people identify with that colour already"
 I don't believe we should change the flag until we are considering becoming a Republic...I believe the two go hand in hand.

For those that want to keep the current flag then tell me what is NZ about it? The Union Jack - that's Britain's flag. Red, white and blue - that's not our national colours. The southern cross - that is seen anywhere in southern hemisphere (and sometimes in the northern hemisphere). I support history and I support change. If we as a country didn't support change then women wouldn't have got the vote, old age pensions wouldn't exist, private radio stations would be prohibited, homosexuality would still be illegal, smoking would still be ok in workplaces and so the list goes on... Change the flag - save the $26m and do it by parliamentary vote like Canada did. It only takes a majority of 1 to change the flag."

Instead this is a waste of time and resources created by a person who will find himself on the wrong side of public opinion eventually. Does he really want to be remembered for such an unnecessary issue? I feel there will be a strong resistance to any change and this is a major underestimation of our nations intelligence."

NO. We all use some variation on the silver fern (so does every New Zealand soldier's headstone). - Will there ever be a 'right time' to change, or will it ever be the highest priority? NO.

 Spending taxpayer money on a more worthy cause than a stupid flag referendum. What's the point in fixing something that ain't broke? We have bigger issues that need to be addressed and all our useless excuse of a prime minister cares about is making NZ a mini USA. No thank you

God is a mythical being some still believe in, to have that in our anthem is appalling. Our anthem should be about our country (which is real), our aspirations (which are real). There is NO place for references to fairies or gods or other silly 9th century creations of imagination. I stand for THAT. I'll consider flag changes if and when we address the REAL issue, which is a national anthem based on 19th century superstitition and witchcraft and which in no way represents anyone other than some hard-core protestant somewhere (and the census shows, that's a tiny minority of us!).

Having sworn allegiance to the Queen, in order to become a citizen, I believe I should speak out and point out that New Zealand has a perfectly good flag which is well recognised, world wide. Should New Zealand, at some point, have a referendum to decide if we should be a Republic or continue to have the Queen as our head of state, then that would be a good time to also consider our flag. We don't need a new flag and we don't need to spend millions on the process. We could be spending that money on underpriviledged children and/or quite a few other noble causes.

" Keep our current Flag as it is, I'm proud of it "

 Aotearoa
" Why do we have to have the flag. We are supposed to have no money to help the poor and the children. Yet we spending far too much money on this flag, when the country needs the money."
 Our flag and a new one is not relevant its too much money and if your stupid enough to spend 26 million dollars on what we can see then think about who needs it most like kids dieng of poverty
 Respecting history
 continuity of our undeniable past. No change.

" flags are stupid, scrap ALL of them"
" freedom, progression, developing our nation."
" I stand for respecting those who died and served under our current flag, those found founded our country and toiled under our flag. I stand for those who have put us on the world stage over the history of time through sport, culture,  science, innovation and acheivements beyond our size under our current flag. This is more than just about a flag, this is about trying to destroy our identity of who we are, where we are from, and where we are going. Lets not change the flag its who we are. "
 A New Flag
 this is NOT me but 
 Change â change to a new flag that will stand the test of time. The old flag has done its dash and needs to go â out with the British ensign and in with a distinctive design that is instantly recognizable as the flag of New Zealand.
" Don't waste money!!! keep the flag... we should be thinking about our people... like Feeding our kids that are still going hungry... helping the people in CHR, how many years later who still don't have homes... How can you justify it!!! The money could be better spent on so many things that our people will actually benefit from."

A country that has been in the media recently due to inadequate state housing  resulting in tragic results. A country that is not going to have qualified doctors due to cutting funding at 7 years meaning finishing degrees is financially impossible for the majority of medical students. A country that is cutting medical funding in the South Island and downgrading much needed hospitals. A country that has children going to school hungry but not having the funds to provide breakfast/lunches in schools. A country that is being made to look heartless by spending this extravagant amount of money on the desires of one man, not the opinions of the nation he leads.

"  I stand for the truth ""as things really are"", not as USA corporations want them to be. Example: John Campbell was fired because he was going to drop a bombshell in regards to the TPPA secret deals and the secret fine print in that con job of a deal. Now we know the truth and we know what happens to people who want to tell it to us. Yesterday the USA corporations took 100% full control of TV3. People must know this by now, as it was in the media. The company that took control is owned by the USA corporations / USA government. So does any of this ring a bell people. Wakey Wakey NZ!   Its all in regards to the changing of the flag for extreme legal purposes only and John Campbell was going to report on this, and the USA completed the take over of our media / our free speech TV3 media and now this is the result! FACT!. Thats it! John Key was paid extremely highly by the USA corporations to come here to win the NZ elections so to then sign the TPPA for the prime reason to create massive open loop holes in the NZ law system. That's the only reason john Key is here for. If you think any differently, then WAKE UP for gods sake - ZOMBIE! The USA corporations are setting up / invading NZ via the legal loop holes in the TPPA agreement to take control of New Zealand mineral rights, farming rights, GMO rights, housing and banking rights, and many more including our water supplies / water rights. The USA will then sell ""our NZ pure water"" back to New Zealanders at extremely high prices, and also ship it overseas to make massive profits for themselves via sales to other countries - just like nestles do already. Watch very carefully as this takes place as soon as our laws are circumvented via the secret fine print that the TPPA deal has within it, i.e. One of John Keys main reasons for being in NZ via being hired by the USA to come here to win the election to do so. Now its up to the Maori to either get rights to a percentage of the water rights for New Zealand people or do what the Red Indian in the USA done and that was to be conned by white collar honkies into gaining a casino or two in Vegas for themselves for the surrounding water rights. Wake up NZ. Will the Maori in NZ do what's right or will they crack and give up their sacred mother to the USA for pennies and a can of tua beer yet again. The time is fast arriving. Lets watch and see shall we! If we take out certain parts of the NZ flag, like the union jack and other aspects of it then massive legal loop holes open up for USA corporations to sue NZ / companies without anyway for NZ to win the cases in court, because the only court then to fight / defend ourselves with, will be their own law system and the lawyers of ""their"" choosing - go figure. Wake up NZ! Certain picture grams in the current NZ flag are legal law system pictures, and those pictures being on the flag actually inhibit the USA / rouge corporations from suing NZ - ripping us off, just like the USA does to many other countries as we all know very clearly. We better keep the flag how it is - or else. Most blue voters don't even know this stuff either. And they don't even want this flag change aswell. Don't be conned any longer. This info written here is the 100% truth. Wake up! Changing the flag isn't for fun, as if its time for a cool change. It's simply a very serious destruction of our sovereignty and your children's wellbeing being placed at massive risk for a few CEO's to get more cash. If you follow the money, you always find the truth ""as it really is"". "

Stand up New Zealand and say we want to keep the flag, it is ours to keep and shouldn't be changed."
 The status quo. Our heritage comes from Britain and I see no reason to abandon that relationship.
 education and equality
" equality, independence, rights, whanau, peace and harmony, education, religious beliefs, cultural traditions, freedom and opportunities. The NZ Flag shouldn't be changed due to the money being used would be great to spend on things useful that benefit each and every individual New Zealander. But then again, the NZ Flag should also have a meaning to us New Zealanders, what we stand for, what we believe in, what symbolizes New Zealand's heritage, traditional roots, religious beliefs etc."

" Constant progress towards equality for all.  End child poverty, end domestic violence, equal pay forwomen.  NZ to stand and walk tall when these achievements have been realised."

" First there should be a vote ' do you want to change the flag?' depending on outcome, this could save NZ over 27 million dollars alone. Then if the answer is yes, change the flag, we should choose new designs. Unless one happens to be on the 'panel' looking at designs and getting paid $600 per hour why would you be happy with all the money being pushed into this issue. And if the flag is changed the cost to the tax payer will be huge, every government department, many other businesses will have to have new logo's, new stationery, new uniforms etc. What a waste of money.  Including that used to etch names on a pole!"

Our Flag has been is used at the Olympics, Commonwealth games and many other world cup events which our athletes have won medals and more importantly we won the rugby world cup with this flag.  I also think that the money being used to produce the new flag could be better spent on other areas such as better health care and education for the future."

Our culture stems from British values and traditions.Our flag may look similar to Australia's but I've never confused them. They have 6 white stars, we have 4 red ones. We had ours first,so they may like to change theirs.Finally if we do change the design  please do not include a fern . It looks too much like a white feather,( at least that's what it will be seen as overseas) It is also a sports branding logo and has no place on something as serious as a national flag.Finally, why are there no vexillologists(person who studies flags), graphic designers, artists or heraldic experts on the flag evaluation panel?"

No-one says you are a silver fern. Our new flag should have a kiwi as its centre piece. Black should also be a prominent colour on it.

 a country that doesn't spend taxpayers money on stupid referendums! We have a perfectly functioning flag that represents where we have come from and our history!  If this is all to do with collecting Maori votes; do the Maori realise that 'flags' are a european idea? That they would be still going along with european ways!? Maybe the government pushing the idea should pay for it using their own wages!   Then its interesting weather we would see the referendum go ahead or not ?!  I'm absolutely discussed with this  decision the government is making (I'm rural NZ'er).  Is power going to someones head by any change?!

" The flag should stay as is, because in the 48 years I have sung the national anthem with my hand on my heart while the flag is being raised, I have been proud to see our flag flying, showing what New Zealand and its people stand for. Also my grand parents and father along with with many others, fought, died and were maimed and have horrific memories of battles fought under our flag. You cannot just change this flag on a whim, or for political reasons. $27,000,000 could be better spent in other areas of our country, such as health and disability, with this money helping New Zealanders who through no fault of their own have suffered medical problems or disfigurement and aren't covered by ACC. These are the things that matter to me and other New Zealanders and make me proud not only to be a Kiwi, but part of the Commonwealth family. As a true New Zealander with a can do and 'fix it with No8 fence wire' attitude, changing the flag seems to me to belittle and diminish the standards and values that make us Kiwis. When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry came to New Zealand, I was proud that we could show off our little country and what it stands for in the world. Having grown up in a multicultural area all my life, the people I have been around, have not been activists, wanting individual nations but have shared common goals of surviving everyday life and living alongside each other."

" a flag that has something meaningful for all. This is more important than a flash pleasing design.  A senior Maori said it for me when talking about celebrating the arrival of Captain Cook.  He spoke of our dual heritage and shared future.  I suggest a sectioned flag with the existing flag in one quadrant - the Maori flag (or other design meaningful to Maori) in another, (sized to balance), a very Treaty honouring thing - and symbols of what we all (regardless of heritage) share.  Perhaps the silver fern, the NZ design Kiwi     (? both white with black outline -recognizable symbols of sport and trade) and maybe a gold ring as a symbol of friendship and love.  Not only do we want such shared things in NZ, but with the rest of the world.  The silver fern and kiwi are associated with NZ internationally, as the maple leaf is with Canada.  Very simple flags may be more easily visible but I wouldn't know which countries they belong to.  A blue background for being islands surrounded by sea."

If this is changed it will affect our bill of rights and the treaty of Waitangi...it is called DUE AUTHORITY..if the union jack is taken away we are open slather to the TPPA being signed in an instant we will go from democracy to Republic(corporate influence)  The writing is on the wall Key is up to no good. He will say we are misinformed but.  do some research for this will take away our rights altogether and fast track the signing of the TPPA just what Key wants.  Our flag was ours before the Aussies had it. Fact!  I notice facebook is changing any info released online by the general public and proffesionals that have studied it for anything we should know about on the real impacts it will have.  facebook is now US owned go figure. Do not vote for a new flag draw our current one and put dont change the flag or current flag to stay.  "

I asked a Canadian customer of mine this week if any Canadians want their old flag back. ""Not a single one"" was the reply. ""Our flag is so distinctive, and unquestionably Canadian. Why would we want the old one?"". We have the same brilliant opportunity NZ. Let's follow Canadas lead and I urge you all to Google the Candian flag debate and read about it."

" not changing the New Zealand flag. It holds so much history and meaning to so many people, especially those who are fighting or have fought for our country. If we change the flag, it would be disrespectful to the generations of New Zealanders that have fought and died under it in many battles. Therefore, this action of changing the flag would be disrespectful to their efforts and sacrifice. Also, the union jack in the flag represents New Zealand's strong past and present ties to the United Kingdom and its history as a part of the British Empire, and the Southern Cross represents our location in the South Pacific. Also, some companies have used the flag in their branding and changing the flag could make them very unhappy as they may feel pressured to change their branding because the flag has been changed and that is a very costly process.

" I think the flag shouldn't be changed. It has been with us for many years, so people already know what our flag is, so people are already used to associating New Zealand with our flag. If we change it people might be confused. Changing the flag also costs the government a lot. The government has to pay for a design, and then they have to change everything that the has the New Zealand flag on it. This would also cost a lot of money, and the government could spend it on more benificial needs. Also if the flag was changed, a lot of people would be against it and it would cause a lot of conflict between people. This would be a hassle for the New Zealand government as people would be mad that the government was wasting millions of dollars on the flag instead of things that could help improve the people or communities or New Zealand.

" not changing the New Zealand flag because it is a part of our culture, which leads back to 1800's. If we change it now there won't be any history behind it so it wont be as unique. The flag also represents England who colonised New Zealand so if the flag is changed there will be no relation or tie to this. Because it has been our flag for many years it means something to the community and changing it would make it feel less special. The flag was made this way for a reason so changing it means these reasons will be forgotten and they are important in the history of New Zealand. "

" Thousand of Kiwi's have fought for fremdom under the presnt flag and untill this country becomes a republic the flag should stay. John key veto's every other referendum so why on earth should the country be interest in areferendum about changing the flag because he wants it.

" keeping NZ's flag as it is now. Our country flag has been like this for a long time now and it has already become our identity and symbol.Although  NZ's flag does have the British flag on the left corner, this symbolizes the history of NZ. Changing the NZ flag will mean the attempt erasing the history we had before, and the past cannot be erased. Changing the NZ flag does not mean that we weren't part of the British Empire; it shows the strong connection the two countries had in the past. What about those who have fought in Gallipoli in WWI with the British and Australian soldiers? What about those who have fought at Passchendaele as a member of ANZAC? We have been using the current flag for centuries now, and changing the flag will only create a misunderstanding of our identity when every other country recognizes us with the flag of blue,white, red, and not the new flag of whatever it is going to be."

 spending money on the things that really matter. Child poverty could really use it. We have much bigger problems needing addressed adequately. The flag is superficial in comparison.
" a new flag for New Zealand. A flag that represents our nation with it's multicultural population and MÄori roots, as opposed to a flag that stands for Britain. We are an individual country and our flag should show that. Also, and perhaps more importantly, our flag currently looks like Australia's flag as well as being quite boring, it's time we embrace our individuality and display our differences and passions for the world to see. We need a likeable and distinctive flag that really shows our national identity and gives us a good appearance overseas. "
" Keeping the existing flag which has served us well.  Sure, a funky new design would be fun, but NOT AT THE EXPENSE .... Seriously, we have children cold and hungry and missing out on hope. Education, health, social services....our fiture depends on looking after our people, not a flag change."

" keep our existing flag, it has served us well since the beginning, why change now."
" not changing the New Zealand flag. There is no need for us to change, it is a waste of time. Some people say that we should because it is too much like all the others, but to me I think it is important that we keep it because it means something to us as a country, it is the flag that has always represented New Zealand as a country. I think it is also a waste of our money. It is money that we don't need to spend, it should go towards something like more education or helping the people in need, not just spent on something we apparently âneed'. People need to realise that there are bigger things is our country that need to be fixed before we decide to change the flag, which has been with us as a country forever. The flag has represented us in so many places, such as the war, the Olympics and much more. It is what other countries recognise New Zealand as. Even though the flag may be similar to others, it is what combines us all as one union. I think that we should keep the flag because there is no needs for us change it. "

Given that in the current context the flag issue will get shoved through, I really recommend watching the following Ted talk which is about flag design. http://www.ted.com/talks/roman_mars_why_city_flags_may_be_the_worst_designed_thing_you_ve_never_noticed#t-5901"

" Our Flag is Based in 4000 years of human history. The union Jack is the uniting again of Jacob's children in one island. As much as Maori are entitled to again find themselves, of which I am happy. Maybe as a nation we need to rediscover our history and re-believe what our fathers fought for. Before you get rid of it why don't you study it. We are a nation that does not have an identity, like the USA or England. We stopped teaching history in schools to our demise."

This sort of nonsence divides a Nation ,for goodness sake get on with something of greater consequence ...."

If so will words that essentially mean the same thing be combined in the ranking eg equality, equal, fair and fairness all appear separately in the list but are the same thing in my opinion. Finally if it becomes totally clear during this stage that the majority of New Zealanders want to keep the existing flag will the referendum be cancelled as surely it will be an unnecessary process and expense with an entirely predictable outcome?? To me personally it doesn't matter what our flag looks like - what matters is what our country looks like/stands for (both to NZers and internationally). In my opinion that is determined by so much more than a flag! I'd apply the analogy that you can't judge a book by its cover; with the flag being the cover of the book while our ACTIONS as individuals, communities, organisations, businesses, and government is the content. I see this whole process as an attempt to divert attention from  the real issues (many of which I feel NZers opinions and needs are not being listened to!) and a blatant attempt to make it appear that the government is listening to the people!  A final question: has rebranding shown any tangible benefits to other organisations/businesses and their customers and business relationships? Eg Telecom/Spark or Z. I would appreciate a reply to my comments via email and text (supplied). "

This will help promote tourism through the silver fern which is already used so much in promoting our sports and other aspects of NZ. Use something simple and famous is what I say.

 a separate national identity that is uniquely New Zealand. We are Kiwis at home so why not world wide? We need a flag that is unique to our nation and country. A good design would be one that uses the kiwi and the silver fern on a black background. Please don't include the Union Jack it only reminds us of our colonial origins. We need a flag that is not easily confused with the Australian flag. I bet that if you asked many Kiwis to choose between the two flags many of them would not know the difference between the Australian and NZ flag. Canada ditched the British flag long ago so why can't we have a distinctive national flag like their Maple Leaf? 
" Keeping the flag, Changing priorities and fixing things that will impact NZ'ers lives such as child poverty, public transport and improving social policy. Whilst i think the flag could be changed, doing so when there are other pressing issues seems selfish and pointless. Build a strong nation, fix inequalities, then give us a flag we can be proud of.

It lets we, the people, make this massive decision. I don't want a colonial artefact to represent me any more. How can I feel a deep connection with a flag that I have to check twice to be sure it's not Australian? I love the Kyle Lockwood design. It really speaks to me and makes me feel something. Alofi Kanter's black and white fern is also awesome. Let's go for awesome."

 Stop wasting money on changing the flag and put this money to building a strong social infrastructure to NZ when so many are living in third world poverty In a  first world nation eg reducing the inequality in people being un able to afford medicine and warm housing and food on the table - the social divide is widening and concentrating on issues like this is a wasteful distraction.

" the Govt to not make decisions which waste people's tax money on a million dollar flag project when there are children going to sleep at night hungry, cold and potentially being robbed of their future.

" Change is good but the cost to change the flag is a bit expensive. There are far more important issues that needs addressing especially the ones that affects our community. I'd say use the funds to come up with something that is income generating to create jobs. $25 - $30M can go a long way to start a new business and maybe once that same amount is earned then perhaps we can go through again the process of changing the flag. No offense to any one who disagrees, but I'd rather see the money spent to help those people begging (e.g. in train station) by creating work so they can help too to our growing community and have an ROI in the end than just spend it outright knowing that we have more important issues to resolve. :)"

" The current Flag. Considering the cost of such referenda for a decision, as well as the ongoing cost of replacing all those ensigns in current use ( flags, painted signs, bronze plaques etc); in the current economic climate funds could be better used. I also feel that attempts will be made to coerse the voters into a particular design already chosen by the few. It also could be said that this issue is currently used to take constituents eyes from more important issues e.g. employment, welfare, health, housing, earthquake (lack of) rebuilding, TPPA, ISIS etc"

We know about child poverty but we must also care for our elderly. But, of, course spending money on a new flag is very important...Obviously aesthetics are far more important than the welfare of people."

" for being a New Zealander, something I am not allowed to call myself because of petty bureaucracy and statisticians within my country but something which my passport tells me I am.  I want to be recognised as a New Zealander, with our own independent identity and our sense of what is right and what is fair.  I want a flag that represents the fact that I am a New Zealander and not a colonial import from somewhere else in the world, that place where I can no longer be a citizen or recognised.  I want a flag to be something that identifies us a separates us from the cultural cringe that our current poor symbol seems to engender in our population, something to be proud of, something that those who fought for our independence can be proud of and who can say our effort was not in vain for now our country can stand for itself and be proud of that.  I find it ironic that in seeking and using symbols for ourselves around the world, our citizens and even our military struggle to display at troop level the flag of their country preferring all manor of other symbols, the time has come to select a single statement that we can all come to accept that is unique to us."

" I stand for taking a lesson from Canada's experience. Canada changed its flag from the Red Ensign (with Union Jack in the canton and coat of arms in the fly) to the red and white Maple Leaf flag 50 years ago. The issue was equally emotive, with the Canadian Legion (RSA equivalent) calling  for no change. But did the Legion represent all the returned servicemen?  No. Or their children? No. The country was awash then with WW1 and WW2 veterans and with baby boomers coming of age. My father, three uncles and an aunt had served in the Canadian military in the war. They fought for the future not the past. When the new Maple Leaf flag was adopted in 1965 they lost no time in proudly flying it from their boats and houses.  Two years later, during Canada's Centennial, the Maple Leaf flag was just everywhere! And it still is two generations later, bold and bright and unmistakably Canadian, proudly flown from the Arctic to the US border. Canada has never looked back! New Zealand now has the chance to do the same."

" A New Zealand where irrespective of your ancestory we are all New Zealanders and there is no classifications as being Maori, European, Pakeha, Samoan, Chinese, etc. Classifications should be at the macro level e.g. Polynesian, Caucasian, Asian, etc. If you want to relate to your ancestory that is fine but it comes with no priviledge or special treatment. Everyone born in New Zealand has the right to free health care and education and is bought up to treat everyone as equal.  It is about going forward as we want to be in 50 or 100 years where a New Zealander is the only classification of people with New Zealand citizenship. Accordingly the flag needs to reflect New Zealand and not races of certain people or past ancestoral claims, e.g. no union jack or star colour of red/white, no maori designs or art works. It needs to relate to landscapes, native animal and plant  speices.   "

For any other person to enable a referendum, hundreds of thousands of people must show their support to have one via petitions and then the outcome does not have to be binding. The first step in this process should have been to seek New Zealanders' support to consider a new flag. This has not been done, nor has parliament voted on the matter. This is undemocratic and therefore wrong. "

Also, a soldier will fight under whatever national flag is the the national flag at the time. If we change the flag, it doesn't mean we are disrespecting the sacrifice of past soldiers. The British flag changed in 1801 to add the Irish patron saint. Was that disrespecting all those who fought for Britain before 1801? Of course not. Canada remains fiercely proud of their British (and French) heritage to this day. A change of flag did not diminish that pride. It actually enhanced their pride in their country and their history. "

" Not changing the New Zealand flag. We are a relatively young country. Why destroy a fragile symbol of our identity and reset the clock when we have just learning to walk. It appears that we have a generation that for some reason believe they are the 'special generation', a selfish generation. One that has not developed an identity that included our nation's flag. While the ants are working these people have been the crickets. They are intent on making superficial legacy and meaning in their lives through novelty. Creating change to make meaning has become a religion recently. Our long time symbol is under attack. The flag currently has history and depth beyond its age, and for those that have been part of service for New Zealand or been in organisations that have learnt respect for our flag this referendum is offensive in the first degree. The flag is something stable, a historic anchor and a unifying reference point in a sea of uncertainty and change and should be enduring. Something new and skin deep in meaning is not going to replace that history and generational memory that transcends time and fashion. Potentially change will destabilise and fragment its citizens. In 20 years time will another generation want change to changes made to our flag again as at that time it means nothing to a bunch of sub sub cultures in terms of what was currently cool that week? What an insulting waste of time and money. People are dying on hospital waiting lists for goodness sakes. Stop the referendum before it wastes more money."

" it is vital that a national flag first represents MÄori who are the indigenous tangata whenua of Aotearoa and is their only homeland. It secondly needs to represent the secondary migrant group of PÄkehÄ settlers, so named by MÄori locating the group here. The flag also needs to represent Te Tiriti o Waitangi, the MÄori text that ensured these dual authorities, in Article 1 PÄkehÄ governance, in Article 2 MÄori sovereignty and equitable human rights in Article 3, as our symbol of being in constant relationship between two different and valued ethnic groups. Other migrants of course are important but you cannot put all migrant groups on a  flag, the two initial ethnic groups and their relationship agreements are critical because all other NZers need to know and be able to honor these. The NZ flag has done its time and service, it is time to be courageous enough to create our own images from this land, not from Britain, this is our chance to respectfully become independent and come into our own. I am a lecturer at Education Dept Auckland University currently writing a critical primary school curriculum of MÄori and PÄkehÄ histories and would be happy to speak further about these ideas."

There's no need to hide our British heritage - that's something to be proud of, too. To make a drastic change is to deny our heritage, insult our ancestors and those who fought and died under our flag."

Sure we now stand in our own right and govern ourselves, but to now turn around and forget our forebares and where we came from, by dropping any relevance to that beginning (on our flag) is insulting to all the Nnew Zealanders who have family lines back to the B.E. Therefore If the flag is to be changed, it must be with compromise for all. Surely a small representation of the Union Jack can be incorporated into a new design, along with Maori and other relevant symbols of NZ."

 It is impossible to create a flag to represent our values. Most national flags are simply a set of colours. They come to have meaning through time. Our current flag represents our history and values - we should only change it if we are ashamed of our history and values. So please don't change it.

 NO CHANGE
 not wasting public money on a referendum especially one which asks the question the wrong way round. First question should be whether we want a change from the current flag. Frankly we have more pressing priorities to spend $26m on such making sure all children go to school well fed.

 at least respect the country to actually ask a simple yes or no question to see if anyone WANTS to change the flag before y=we spend excessive amounts on people to design a new flag. The rates of child poverty in NZ is pretty bad so I wonder where we could get some funding to help with this mmmmm
 Being British and NO change

 Spending money investing in New Zealanders health and well being over a new flag. We need to get our priorities right and stop wasting money.

" Changing the flag so that is individual to NZ. We need to stand out from the rest of the Commonwealth. We are unique.

 Leaving the flag as it is.  I believe changing the flag is a cynical ploy by the Government to draw attention away from our ever-mounting national debt and increasing poverty in New Zealand.
" spending money on the people who need it, not on the flag design. For me, a new flag is just marketing, and in this it is like creating a false advertisement for a broken down car."

" Respecting the flag for what it is and honouring my country by what I do. I'm not defined by the flag, my country isn't defined by the flag.

I'm proud of, and thankful for the many New Zealanders that have helped make our land greater by their efforts and sacrificers."

 not wasting taxpayer money on something noone wants to change. Keep our history and identity.
" this is a stupid and completely misplaced campaign. Is this Government funded? Where the heck does it say anything about who's behind it? Appalling waste of funds, utterly unfocused, an embarrassment and a vanity project. I might have had half a mind before to think of change, but this nonsense just confirms it's exactly that.  PR folk, you should probably think about other career choices."
 The flag we have is great.  The union jack shows the british heritage this nation is based upon and all the great legal and constitutional benefits - including cultural  ( note- I have no british ancestry myself)  The jack sits on the blue symbolising the vast Pacific we live on.  And the stars symbolise the remote scattered islands that so shape our identity.
" Leaving the flag as it is. We should be proud of our history - and continue to support what our Great, Great, Grandparents and Parents fought for. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging the Commonwealth in our flag with the union jack. And our stars in the Southern Cross, are our guide - compass if you like; that pinpoints our home. If there were to be any change made - perhaps adding a small silver fern and koru somewhere in the flag. But keeping the Union Jack, Stars and colour scheme. "

" leaving the flag as it is. This is not the first time NZ'ers will have a say because what NZ'ers say does not matter to John Key. He has totally ignored referendums before so why should he be any different now. In fact, the very fact he is spending so much of our money on this is criminal because in the end he will do what he wants anyway. Leave our flag alone and focus on more important issues like a living wage and a living welfare system and better health care and education."

 The history of this country and keeping the flag as it is. This process is insulting. Ask people if the want to change the flag FIRST. $26000000 is a dreadful waste of money at a time when so many people are suffering hardship. Our forebears will be turning in their graves. Leave our proud flag the way it is. This process is a manipulative sham.
 not wasting more public money doing something that serves political ends to distract everyone from government failure.
" Respecting the lessons from the past and the present. Change the flag.  Their allegiance is to the EU.  Remove the union jack and replace the flag with a point of differentiation that makes our unique country stand out.

They sacrificed much and fought for our freedom not a piece of material. Honour their lessons by changing the flag."

Personally I vote against a change. The current flag holds so much history from all walks of life. Academically, culturally and in sport and recreation. The history is on going. The amount of tax payer funds used to change the flag is ridiculous. It is no wonder the John Key govt. can't reach the surplus goal. Vote against change."

" Independence, democracy, tolerance, common sense and resilance. A flag should represent all its people, it's history, what it stands for and what it wants to be in the future. The current flag doesn't represent my grandfather who fought in WWI, he wasn't there for the flag, or my daughter and her future in a highly mobile and transitional world. I am happy to take the time and relatively small cost to find out of how far we have come as a nation. It will change one day, are we ready now."

 insulting the intelligence of every New Zealander in attempting to trick us with this backward process. JFK really does think we're all stupid.
" free speech. You won't publish my flag ideas because they identify that 622,000 New Zealanders live in poverty, or because they make a mockery of the flag debate on the same level as the mockery which is the flag debate. It is a political distraction at a time of immense global social upheaval. We're sending people to Iraq to fight under this new flag without a proper political debate - essentially mirroring the murder of the ANZAC troops. We're spending millions on debating a flag and nothing on children in poverty. Young people cannot afford to participate in society unless they have rich parents, but instead of fixing that let's have a referendum about complete bull. Shame on you all for participating in this charade. "

" inclusiveness. And representing our country as where it stands now, not just where it did in the past. While it is important to honor what the existing flag means to many people â and mostly for historical experiences â it does not adequately represent NZ as it has changed to this day. It is important to acknowledge there is much more than British heritage. Let's offer a unifying symbol, a symbol that better represents who we are now and for some time to come. Look at the Canadian process of adopting a new flag and a more fitting identity for who they are. It worked. We can do it, too. If we are concerned about cost we may achieve more savings if we consider not building more motorways or other really big expenses. Yes, definitely worth doing, long overdue. We need it."

" stopping this wasteful campaign and prioritising other, valid issues.

 Equality of opportunity. We are too rich a nation to have so many people living in poverty. It's not acceptable.
 keeping the flag because it's going to cost so much to change and NZ has greater issues to spend money on than this.

 A unique identity for NZ - we don't need to ride the coat tails of Britain. (Surely we've grown up as a nation and don't need to hold mummy's hand?) I support Kyle Lockwood's flag design http://www.silverfernflag.org
" A creative, multicultural community that has health and education for all and to keep our beautiful country green. "

" I would really like a new flag for NZ, excluding the Union Jack.  I am happy for it to have some Maori motif or a silver fern or the southern cross.  Strong colours of red, green, white, blue and black would look good."
" leaving the New Zealand flag as it is. We cannot erase the history of what has made this country what it is, and changing the flag is an attempt to do just that. It will be a complete waste of taxpayer money to change something that is not broken."

" a nation that is independent and free to make its own decisions. Independent not to have another country's flag in the corner, and free to make the decision to change its flag to something that represents its multicultural and ideals more appropriately. Colours should show our ocean bound location, green for our clean ideals, scenic beauty and agricultural industries, and white for Aotearoa and our coastlines."

 Not wasting money on a new flag when there are bigger issues in New Zealand let alone the world. I would prefer money to be spent on Christchurch 
 common sense!  The first referendum should ask if we want the flag changed so no more money needs to be spent when you see the overwhelming majority will show we want to keep our existing flag.  What a waste of money to have a referendum suggesting 4 alternatives first!  
" Listening to what the majority are saying here; I believe it's called democracy. I stand for the flag as it stands now. Not because I'm against change, but because I stand for spending the millions where it's needed, not on 'flag - flying'. I invite the PM  to stand alongside me and stand up for childhood poverty, an equitable health "

 As a descendant of dutch parernts who lived in occupied Holland during the second world war I stand for the freedom to believe in myself and those who surround me to have freedom of belief and build ours and our childrens future under our current banner. My wife's father fought inn Korea  under our current flag and to change it would be an insult to our forebears whofought for our freedom of expression and belief that we coulld work together as a nation of immigrants to achieve safety and integrity within the moddern world society to achieve a peaceful and intergarted society that can and does  influence others views of the world in a positive way into the future.

" leaving the NZ flag as it is and spending money on the things that will save New Zealanders money in the future. We could start by feeding children healthy meals in schools, so they don't present to hospital with rotten teeth and obesity which is all too prevalent in our health care system today. Funding more medications and treatments that fight disease that should be available to New Zealanders, as they are to those who live overseas. Funding front line services such as rescue helicopters, ambulance, and the SPCA, so that they can put all their efforts into saving lives rather than looking for funding. Saving our heritage by ensuring our rare native flora and fauna are preserved  for our future generations. We should not change our flag, instead we should be proud of our heritage and our past. Use this money to change our future for the benefit of all New Zealanders."

" Keeping the flag that our ancestors collectively fought for during 2 world wars, even though it wasn't their war to fight. The flag embodies the nature of our great nation of people with a 'can do' approach to anything. By changing our flag for the unwarranted desire of our current PM we are essentially starting from scratch and deleting 170 years of history. I agree with the majority on here who would rather see our PM get off his pedestal and LISTEN to kiwis from all cultures. The consensus is that some $25M on this pointless exercise is better spent on REAL issues such as healthcare, poverty, issues with children who don't eat well enough."

 rational thought and commonsense. It is a no-brainer not to establish first of all whether people actually support the idea of changing the flag. Further more it is an inconsequential and unimportant issue when compared with huge issues that confront the country and our society today. It is highly irresponsible in my view to throw $27m of tax-payers' money at a mere diversion.
" Aotearoa NZ, leaders, pioneers, visionaries, entrepreneurs, practicle minded kiwis courageous and endearing. Building a Sustainable future for generations to come.

 not wasting taxpayer's money on this horrifically expensive project. Please leave the flag alone and spend the money on health and housing.
" leaving the flag the way it is.  If anything , the logical process is to ask New Zealanders if they want to change the flag BEFORE asking which design they prefer.  Let's get our books back into the black and spend money wisely on things that matter rather than frivously on things that do not affect the day to day running of our country"
 A lot say we should keep the flag because of the war days but our troops also had the  Kiwi and the fern on their uniforms.

We regaularly all get to see and remember their graves as Returned Servicemen plots will always be present and not even useless politicians or sports people will have their graves or plaques remembered at all in comparison."

 A UNITED New Zealand under our present flag. NOT a politically motivated divisive 'new' flag - I suggest: beware of John Key's motive.
 Please leave the
 NOT changing NZ's flag. This referenda exercise is a total waste of money which could and should be allocated to financially desperate social services.  Who has the mandate to even consider a change? Tax payers' money is being frittered away on a futile example of puffery. All this glossy media PR overkill is sickening.  I repeat:  We stand for NOT changing the flag.

 I stand for a new flag design that is uniquely New Zealand.
" I believe our country has evolved to a point where our national sovereignty, our international image as a country that presents an independent presence in world affairs requires a new flag that better represents our modern demographic, and our confident place in the world of nations."

" leave the flag alone, there's plenty better ways to spend 26 million, like lunches for hungry kids at school.  we don't need to boost anyone's ego over this, its already bloated as it is."
" keeping our National Flag the same. Many thousands of New Zealanders have served under it, not only in World Wars but in the many conflicts since.  Keep it this way. Etch my name on the pole only if our current National Flag flies from it."
" keeping the present flag. Both Maori and Pakeha served side by side on the battlefields along with other races giving many lives to protect both the present flag and the country. One would think that those who lost their lives fought to create a better N.Z for future generations, that they did not give their lives in vain, to a country divided by a flag. Those who lost their lives would turn in their graves, knowing that infrastructure has been sold,, health services rundown, education no longer free, housing unaffordable, and more. It's sad that tens of millions can be found to debate a flag, but no money is available for housing, health, education, or the elderly, no money for infrastructure that's run down or employment and HOPE for the younger generations. Let's keep the flag that my ancestors fought and died for. We as descendants of these people need to show compassion and dignity to our fore-parents and make them proud, so that they rest in peace and honour and so we will always remember the sacrifice they made for us."
" New Zealand, freedom and equality.  Our flag will always represent this, what ever the design. I think the flag should be immediately recognisable to the world as New Zealand."
 Spending taxpayers dollars where it's NEEDED. A flag won't educate our kids or help our needy. Let's be productive.
" our men that fought for our country and the flag as we have now. Our flag holds our history, our identity and pride. Those millions of dollars could be better spent instead of knee jerk third term stupidity moments."
 an end to pointless surveys.   What is standfor?   What has it to do with the flag?   What is it costing? What will happen to the results?   Another useless exercise thought up by academics removed from the real world?

Thousands of war veterans have sacrificed their lives in honour of fighting for their country(flag), making the place we grow up in a safe place for the next generations, and all of a sudden a group of people think we should change our countries flag? Well i guess the saying ""Its the minority that ruin it for the majority"" is true. We are willing to spend around 20 Million dollars on each referendum to decide on a flag? This is criminal, we have thousands of children starving right before us, families struggling to look after their family and we are wanting to spend around 40 Million dollars on a new flag? Just think how much 40 Million dollars could do for struggling families and kids across New Zealand. Have a good long think New Zealand, we cant all have the things we want in life just like a struggling family cant have a hot nutritious meal every night.

" What I or anyone elsestands for is irrelevant to the design of a new flag.  If a new flag goes ahead, all it should do is to visually depict something that is distinctly New Zealand e.g. the kiwi, the mountains, a fern etc.  A new flag would need to be one that is easily recognised by people from other countries as the NZ flag in the same way as the Canadian flag depicts the maple leaf.  Better still, stick with the current flag instead of wasting money on it and this associated campaign and spend the money on more important things e.g. child poverty."

Let's have a fair society where the average New Zealander gets decent education, healthcare and housing, where everyone has work and their efforts are appreciated and rewarded well enough to support themselves and their dependents (that includes flag designers too).  Right now we don't have that, so this is not the time to waste money on a flag referendum.  I quite like the idea of a new flag, but it's a ânice to have' and we need to deal with the essentials first."

Please give children a voice in this decision. And please give us more than four choices. We need choices of colours at least on the four we most like.

Changing the anthem certainly wouldn't need this immense waste of money.

" I believe the current flag is acceptable because the Southern Cross is an important recognition of how we all arrived here as immigrants. I also think the Union Jack is an important symbol of the Crown and the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi with Maori. I think it is important to keep the historical elements of our flag intact because we need to remember how Aotearoa/New Zealand became the place of home for us all who reside here: Tangata whenua and later comers like Pakeha and later settlers. If we must change the flag then please retain the symbols already in it, maybe stylised to represent the longed-for unitedness and new beginnings from an old and vital standpoint. Please do not change the flag without recognising the need to retain the sense of important historical contexts that Aotearoa/New Zealand lives with to this day."

" A flag that shows our close ties with Australia, a Union Jack showing our historic links with Britain, a Southern Cross representing our clear blue skies and a blue background representing the Pacific Ocean.  Keep our flag!  Bugger John Key and this self indulgent waste of money that could have been spent on real problems!"
" spending $27,000,000 on more useful things than considering changes to a perfectly good and internationally acceptable flag."

 putting our resources into assisting the disadvantaged people in our country and reducing the gap between rich and poor. We are judged by what we do for our citizens not by arbitrary symbols.

The flag question is just a diversion from the real issues we should be putting our all our strength and resources to solve.

We still have the Queen as the head of state so there is some relevance to the Union Jack in the top left corner of the e flag. If we were a republic then there may be some reason for change.

 Not wasting money on a debate no one wants there are other priorities

 New Zealand and a prudent use of taxpayers money. Changing the flag for no particular reason is a total waste of money and time. Lets determine if the majority want to change first

 NO Need to change it. Waste of Time and Money 
" looking after each other, a quality that is fast being lost.  We are a proud pacific nation and spending money on a national Branding exercise is a waste when we can put those millions back into teaching better parenting skills, helping unemployed NZers realise their potential, and get supported into work.  There is also a huge gap for young people and sufficient training and apprenticeship focus.  We have the chance to be a proud pacific nation.  I would rather be asked about that than a flag."

 As a modern day returned serviceman I ask to leave the flag alone. Don't change it. Keep it as it is. Our grandparents sacrificed a lot during there time and we should have the decency to show some respect.

 Leave the flag alone and put the mony to better use.

" For a NZ where everyone is equal and has opportunity for advancement. A country where no one people have special treatment or rights. I support a new flag with a unique identity. A black with a silver fern. A flag that I would identify with and be proud of. A flag that would be instantly recognisable to people other than Australians and Brittish. Not a flag that links us as a dependent of, and controlled by, the ""motherland""."

 a country that helps it's blind citizens see the flag and its deaf citizens hear their anthem. A country that wouldn't slash ACC funding of hearing aids by 75% and a country that gets our elderly the cataract surgery they need. Changing the flag is a government-run sideshow to avoid the real stuff
 I stand for the present flag-
" Not wasting $25 million dollars on changing a bloody flag, what a waste of time and money!"
" Traditional values and recognition of those who have made our country what it is today. Men and women who sacrificed time , , thought, effort and in some cases their lives to ensure future generations have a world where they can have the right to make decisions such as what our national standard should look like. Honour the past and our tipuna by keeping our flag as it is."

 Equal rights and equal representation. I stand for a strong future for our kids. I stand for our current flag. This flag is the national and international symbol of our collective identity. A flag is not meant to be a brand. Our flag is known around the world and represents us as a strong nation. A lot of what happened under that flag made us the New Zealand we are today. Keep it. We would only weaken our national and international strength for a long time while implementing and getting used to a new one. Keep it.

We are a modern, liberal, progressive,  democratic and diverse country and we shouldn't be afraid of change. Our current flag isn't broken, but it can be improved.

 Keeping my flag just how it is and having respect for those who have lived and died for it. 
" being accurate; the video constantly refers to 'the Union Jack', which it is not - it is the Union Flag. Before we go anywhere further down this 'new flag' track, it would be good to know what John Key really stands for, but I doubt he'd ever say.  The way the country seems to be heading in wholeheartedly embracing 'all things American' (the worst possible thing they could do), we might as well fly the stars and stripes and have done with it!  Wake up NZ - don't be wannabe Yanks, don't be Brits, don't be (just) Maori - learn to be yourselves - New Zealanders!"

And so many more.

" the indigenous people of this land choosing the Flag if Government is hell bent on enforcing change.  Seems like the current Flag was chosen by foreign hands according to the video.  Looks like The United Tribes of NZ Flag was the only one that had Maori input at the time.  And we say New Zealanders yet we have a Maori Flag and a New Zealand Flag which continues to question this quest for ""we are all New Zealanders""  With so much oppression already had why go and waste money making it worse.  You may as well have a White Blank Flag since Government see a need to wipe history."

" The well being of New Zealanders, a standard of living we can all be proud of and common sense to prevail. We don't need a new flag. People immigrate to NZ because of the opportunities and quality of life we can give them which is often better than from where they came. Not because we have a designer flag. Be reasonable and spend the money where it is truly needed. If we have so much spare cash to throw around, why do we have so many on the poverty line? Help your people Mr Key and Government, don't squander their well-being on a symbol which not everyone will support or gain any more pride than our current flag which has served us well so far."
 spending the money being wasted on this exercise on public healthcare. It is anachronistic that a government hellbent on pursuing globalization should even consider having a national flag.

Do NOT allow the Flag to be changed - especially not by a small Minority, but cherish the Memories of those who fought for it, and will continue to do so. Do not allow Change for only Change's Sake, but rather keep the Tradition of some thing we have had all this Time - there is no need to change all things. If we want change, then change what should be changed, such as high crime, poverty, unemployment and ill discipline, and do not allow Money to be wasted on a Flag I believe not as many People want, and would cause Contention at a Time we need to Unite. Other Symbols of this Nation are fine for Sports Events and the Like, but at least let us retain this Official Symbol of this Land we love, a Symbol that has served us well for over a Century."
" Retaining the NZ flag as it is.  I stand for NZ as a nation of people who have a flag that already achieves all it needs to.  I stand for John Key dismantling not our existing flag, but his plan to create a political legacy for himself in changing our flag.  The money set aside for flag recreation should be immediately redirected into supporting the poverty stricken out of poverty here in NZ, so that those people can have faith in our nation as one that invests in our people, not in our ""brand""."

One is for holding on. One is for letting go.â "

" Democracy. This campaign is a sad excuse for a joke. One man, John Key, had an opinion about a major constitutional aspect. It was not an election issue. He then used his powerful position to force a previously ""non-issue"" into the public consideration via an expensive publicity stunt. This is failed democracy in my opinion. The government is elected to represent the will of the majority. Yes, they can make tough decisions without consultation when needed, but that should only be when necessary. Based on recent polling a solid majority of people do not support changing the flag. This campaign is an attempt to manipulate the public psyche by the use of emotional imagery and public figures. The reality is that one day we will be a republic, and one day we will need to consult the nation on a new flag. At the moment, there is greater public concern over housing, poverty, transport  and healthcare. $26 million worth of referenda could make a big change to one of those key areas, which the public have expressed major concern in. That is democracy."

" 90% of the posts combined on this site, which overwhelming speak to the massive issues we now have in NZ concerning our most vulnerable citizens, the deferential attitude our government has to the people of NZ, their opinions and the way they wish their country to be run.  This website is genius for the fact that it serves as a giant ""flag"" for people to have a say in decisions concerning $26m and beyond. Its a flag alright...but what are our options?"
" leaving our flag how it is. In times where there is so much more to invest in like child poverty, helping our neighbours in Nepal, helping people become aware and in charge of their own health issues, protecting our green image and moving towards being the leaders we can be for climate change.Our flag can bear the pride of positive action and impact. It is a waste of time and money changing it. Devote the time and money to something that will have greater impact and create everlasting loyalty to our existing flag."

" democracy and fairness, not wasting $26m on a flag referendum when there are far more important issues in NZ right now, such as child poverty, inequality, the environment, and the risk of losing our sovereignty if this government signs the TPPA. What good is a new flag if we lose our sovereign rights?"
 Don't change what is'nt broken!
 leaving the flag the same and not spending 26M on something we dont need

The taxpayers are overwhelmingly declaring ""WE DO NOT WANT THIS CHANGE"" and there are many would-be taxpayers who will not be as long as the government's money is thrown at imaginary problems, not the very real ones facing our nation's youth. $26 million would employ a thousand citizens full time at just under the current median wage ($27,000).

 A Country where the Government listens to its People. When we say We Don't Want A Flag Change and they arrogantly go ahead anyway wasting millions of dollars .. then the Government is saying that what the People stand for doesn't mean squat.

Sorry, but I don't live there anymore. I live in a young, strong, vibrant and  unique country I'm proud to call my own. Change the flag, and with it our drab, conservative, Scottish Presbytarian attitudes. Move on."

 Preserving my and our history 
" Being couragous, homest an acting with integrity. Saying what you believe and being proud of who you are. I personally don't feel the flag needs to be changed as i believe that the money that would be spend/used on the production of a new ome could go a long way to help make a change with the poverty problem that we are faced each day when children are sent to school with no lunch, empty tummies and bare feet.

 Fairness and Equality
 Keeping the original New Zealand Flag.
 everything newzealand has to offer
 changing the flag to something distinctive and unique that represents who we are in the modern world. We should not forget our heritage but we should forge our own future and be proud of our special nation. A flag symbolises who we are. Changing it does not mean we denigtate the past or our history. The process represents an opportunity to participate and have a say. If we choose the status quo then thats not bad either. If it causes reflections on our identity and our place in the world then it will be a success no matter the outcome.
 a change to the flag to more closely represent waht we are as a people and a nation.  The present flag does not in any way differentiate us as a unique society and people - a new flag carefully chosen - will.

" A country where people are told the truth about what the toxic chemicals in our food and household products our doing to our health, our ecosystem and environment.   I stand for a country that supports a return to eating real food created from whole foods produced locally.  It's twisted that we allow companies and industries to brainwash us with messages about consuming food that in most cases has no real nutritional value, is packed full of chemicals and has detrimental effects on long term health."
